            "text": "From its first emergence in Wuhan, China in December, 2019 the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented health crisis throughout the world. The novel coronavirus disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which belongs to the coronaviridae family. In this paper, a comparative genomic analysis of eight coronaviruses namely Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Bat coronavirus RaTG13 has been carried out using Chaos Game Representation and Fisher-Shannon Complexity (CGR-FSC) measure. Chaos Game Representation (CGR) is a unique alignment-free method to visualize one dimensional DNA sequence in a two-dimensional fractal-like pattern. The two-dimensional CGR pattern is then quantified by Fisher-Shannon Complexity (FSC) measure. The CGR-FSC can effectively identify the viruses uniquely and their similarity/dissimilarity can be revealed in the Fisher-Shannon Information Plane (FSIP)."

            "text": "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant repercussion on the health, economy, politics and environment, making coronavirus-related issues more complicated and difficult to solve adequately by relying on a single field. Interdisciplinary research can provide an effective solution to complex issues in the related field of coronavirus. However, whether coronavirus related research becomes more interdisciplinary still needs corroboration. In this study, we investigate interdisciplinary status of the coronavirus-related fields via the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). To this end, we calculate bibliometric indicators of interdisciplinarity and a co-occurrence analysis method. The results show that co-occurrence relationships between cited disciplines have evolved dynamically over time. The two types of co-occurrence relationships, Immunology and Microbiology & Medicine and Chemical Engineering & Chemistry, last for a long time in this field during 1990-2020. Moreover, the number of disciplines cited by coronavirus-related research increases, whereas the distribution of disciplines is uneven, and this field tends to focus on several dominant disciplines such as Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology. We also gauge the disciplinary diversity of COVID-19 related papers published from January to December 2020; the disciplinary variety shows an upward trend, while the degree of disciplinary balance shows a downward trend. Meanwhile, the comprehensive index 2Ds demonstrates that the degree of interdisciplinarity in coronavirus field decreases between 1990 and 2019, but it increases in 2020. The results help to map the interdisciplinarity of coronavirus-related research, gaining insight into the degree and history of interdisciplinary cooperation."

Genes acting as repressors and activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators (HMGA2; INSIG1) were then employed to identify existing drugs that could be repurposed to mitigate the coronavirus infection. Present analyses identify Vitamin D and Quercetin as promising pandemic mitigation agents. Gene expression profiles of Vitamin D and Quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances suggest that they may represent viable candidates for further assessment and considerations of their potential as coronavirus pandemic mitigation agents. Notably, gene set enrichment analyses and expression profiling experiments identify multiple drugs, most notably testosterone, dexamethasone, and doxorubicin, smoking, and many disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus infection-promoting agents. Discordant patterns of Testosterone versus Estradiol impacts on SCARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular explanation of the apparently higher male mortality during coronavirus pandemic."

In practical analytics, it is important to find the maximum of coronavirus cases per day, this point means the estimated half time of coronavirus spread in the region under investigation. The obtained results show that different crises with different reasons have different impact on the same stocks. It is important to analyze their impact separately. Bayesian inference makes it possible to analyze the uncertainty of crisis impacts."

            "text": "A novel bioinspired metaheuristic is proposed in this work, simulating how the coronavirus spreads and infects healthy people. From an initial individual (the patient zero), the coronavirus infects new patients at known rates, creating new populations of infected people. Every individual can either die or infect and, afterwards, be sent to the recovered population. Relevant terms such as re-infection probability, super-spreading rate or traveling rate are introduced in the model in order to simulate as accurately as possible the coronavirus activity. The Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm has two major advantages compared to other similar strategies. First, the input parameters are already set according to the disease statistics, preventing researchers from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the ability of ending after several iterations, without setting this value either. Infected population initially grows at an exponential rate but after some iterations, when considering social isolation measures and the high number recovered and dead people, the number of infected people starts decreasing in subsequent iterations. Furthermore, a parallel multi-virus version is proposed in which several coronavirus strains evolve over time and explore wider search space areas in less iterations. Finally, the metaheuristic has been combined with deep learning models, in order to find optimal hyperparameters during the training phase. As application case, the problem of electricity load time series forecasting has been addressed, showing quite remarkable performance."

Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 can provide insights on drug design and vaccine development for controlling the pandemic. Inverted repeats in a genome greatly impact the stability of the genome structure and regulate gene expression. Inverted repeats involve cellular evolution and genetic diversity, genome arrangements, and diseases. Here, we investigate the inverted repeats in the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome. We found that SARS-CoV-2 genome has an abundance of inverted repeats. The inverted repeats are mainly located in the gene of the Spike protein. This result suggests the Spike protein gene undergoes recombination events, therefore, is essential for fast evolution. Comparison of the inverted repeat signatures in human and bat coronaviruses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is mostly related SARS-related coronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RaTG13. The study also reveals that the recent SARS-related coronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RmYN02, has a high amount of inverted repeats in the spike protein gene. Besides, this study demonstrates that the inverted repeat distribution in a genome can be considered as the genomic signature. This study highlights the significance of inverted repeats in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and presents the inverted repeats as the genomic signature in genome analysis."

In particular, blockchain can combat pandemics by enabling early detection of outbreaks, ensuring the ordering of medical data, and ensuring reliable medical supply chain during the outbreak tracing. Moreover, AI provides intelligent solutions for identifying symptoms caused by coronavirus for treatments and supporting drug manufacturing. Therefore, we present an extensive survey on the use of blockchain and AI for combating COVID-19 epidemics.

These new findings are slow to translate to clinical interventions, leading to poorer patient outcomes and unnecessary deaths. One reason is that clinicians, overwhelmed by patients, struggle to keep pace with the rate of new coronavirus literature. A potential solution is developing a tool for evaluating coronavirus literature using large language models (LLMs) -- neural networks that are deployed for natural language processing. LLMs can be used to summarize and extract user-specified information. The greater availability and advancement of LLMs and pre-processed coronavirus literature databases provide the opportunity to assist clinicians in evaluating coronavirus literature through a coronavirus literature specific LLM (covLLM), a tool that directly takes an inputted research article and a user query to return an answer. Using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), we produced two datasets: (1) synCovid, which uses a combination of handwritten prompts and synthetic prompts generated using OpenAI, and (2) real abstracts, which contains abstract and title pairs. covLLM was trained with LLaMA 7B as a baseline model to produce three models trained on (1) the Alpaca and synCovid datasets, (2) the synCovid dataset, and (3) the synCovid and real abstract datasets. These models were evaluated by two human evaluators and ChatGPT. Results demonstrate that training covLLM on the synCovid and abstract pairs datasets performs competitively with ChatGPT and outperforms covLLM trained primarily using the Alpaca dataset."

Using the new Facebook Ads Library, we discover advertisers from public health and non-profit sectors, alongside those from news media, politics, and business, incorporating coronavirus into their messaging and agenda. We find the virus used in political attacks, donation solicitations, business promotion, stock market advice, and animal rights campaigning. Among these, we find several instances of possible misinformation, ranging from bioweapons conspiracy theories to unverifiable claims by politicians. As we make the dataset available to the community, we hope the advertising domain will become an important part of quality control for public health communication and public discourse in general."

            "text": "At the time of this writing, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak has already put tremendous strain on many countries' citizens, resources and economies around the world. Social distancing measures, travel bans, self-quarantines, and business closures are changing the very fabric of societies worldwide. With people forced out of public spaces, much conversation about these phenomena now occurs online, e.g., on social media platforms like Twitter. In this paper, we describe a multilingual coronavirus (COVID-19) Twitter dataset that we have been continuously collecting since January 22, 2020. We are making our dataset available to the research community (https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs). It is our hope that our contribution will enable the study of online conversation dynamics in the context of a planetary-scale epidemic outbreak of unprecedented proportions and implications. This dataset could also help track scientific coronavirus misinformation and unverified rumors, or enable the understanding of fear and panic -- and undoubtedly more. Ultimately, this dataset may contribute towards enabling informed solutions and prescribing targeted policy interventions to fight this global crisis."

Although the virus family is well-known, this specific virus presents considerable differences, as higher transmission rates, being a challenge for diagnostic methods, treatments and vaccines. Coronavirus(C++).pro is a C++ application which simulates Coronavirus replication cycle. This software has identified virus type in short times and provided FASTA files of virus proteins, a list of mRNA sequences and secondary structures. Furthermore, the software has identified a list of structural, non-structural and accessory proteins in 2019-nCoV virus genome more similar to SARS than to MERS, as several fusion proteins characteristics of this virus type. These results are useful as a first step in order to develop diagnostic methods, new vaccines or antiviral drugs, which could avoid virus replication in any stage: fusion inhibitors, RdRp inhibitors and PL2pro/3CLpro protease inhibitors."

Possible mechanisms of such influence can be due to the appearance of large, about 140 bar, non comprehensive capillary pressures and the associated dynamic forces during the movement of the evaporation front in a sample with the virus. A simulation of isothermal evaporation of a thin liquid sample based on the Stefan problem was performed. The comparison of simulation data and recent experiments on the coronavirus survival on various surfaces showed that the rate of isothermal evaporation of aqueous samples, which is higher for heat-conducting materials, correlates well with the lifetime of the coronavirus on these surfaces."

Across multiple data sources, quantitative methods, and levels of analysis, we find four consistent themes characterizing Wikipedia's unique large-scale, high-tempo, and temporary online collaborations: external events as drivers of activity, spillovers of activity, complex patterns of editor engagement, and the shadows of the future. In light of increasing concerns about online social platforms' abilities to govern the conduct and content of their users, we identify implications from Wikipedia's coronavirus collaborations for improving the resilience of socio-technical systems during a crisis."

This paper attempts to frame the coronavirus tradeoff problem as an economic optimization problem and proposes mathematical optimization methods to make rationally optimal decisions when faced with trade-off situations such as those involved in managing through the recent coronavirus pandemic. The framework introduced and the method proposed in this paper are on the basis of the theory of rational choice at a societal level, which assumes that the government is a rational, benevolent agent that systematically and purposefully takes into account the social marginal costs and social marginal benefits of its actions to its citizens and makes decisions that maximize the society's well-being as a whole. We approach solving this tradeoff problem from a static as well as a dynamic point of view. Finally, we provide several numerical examples clarifying how the proposed framework and methods can be applied in the real-world context."

            "text": "The metaheuristic optimization technique attained more awareness for handling complex optimization problems. Over the last few years, numerous optimization techniques have been developed that are inspired by natural phenomena. Recently, the propagation of the new COVID-19 implied a burden on the public health system to suffer several deaths. Vaccination, masks, and social distancing are the major steps taken to minimize the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus. Considering the social distance to combat the coronavirus epidemic, a novel bio-inspired metaheuristic optimization model is proposed in this work, and it is termed as Social Distancing Induced Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm (COVO). The pace of propagation of the coronavirus can indeed be slowed by maintaining social distance. Thirteen benchmark functions are used to evaluate the COVO performance for discrete, continuous, and complex problems, and the COVO model performance is compared with other well-known optimization algorithms. The main motive of COVO optimization is to obtain a global solution to various applications by solving complex problems with faster convergence. At last, the validated results depict that the proposed COVO optimization has a reasonable and acceptable performance."

Materials and Methods: Multiple international datasets, including from Chinese disease-infected areas were included. We present a system that utilizes robust 2D and 3D deep learning models, modifying and adapting existing AI models and combining them with clinical understanding. We conducted multiple retrospective experiments to analyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected COVID-19 thoracic CT features and to evaluate evolution of the disease in each patient over time using a 3D volume review, generating a Corona score. The study includes a testing set of 157 international patients (China and U.S). Results: Classification results for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT studies were 0.996 AUC (95%CI: 0.989-1.00) ; on datasets of Chinese control and infected patients. Possible working point: 98.2% sensitivity, 92.2% specificity. For time analysis of Coronavirus patients, the system output enables quantitative measurements for smaller opacities (volume, diameter) and visualization of the larger opacities in a slice-based heat map or a 3D volume display. Our suggested Corona score measures the progression of disease over time. Conclusion: This initial study, which is currently being expanded to a larger population, demonstrated that rapidly developed AI-based image analysis can achieve high accuracy in detection of Coronavirus as well as quantification and tracking of disease burden."

This has been exacerbated by social isolation during the pandemic and the social stigma associated with mental health and substance use disorders, making people reluctant to share their struggles and seek help. Due to the anonymity and privacy they provide, social media emerged as a convenient medium for people to share their experiences about their day to day struggles. Reddit is a well-recognized social media platform that provides focused and structured forums called subreddits, that users subscribe to and discuss their experiences with others. Temporal assessment of the topical correlation between social media postings about mental health/substance use and postings about Coronavirus is crucial to better understand public sentiment on the pandemic and its evolving impact, especially related to vulnerable populations. In this study, we conduct a longitudinal topical analysis of postings between subreddits r/depression, r/Anxiety, r/SuicideWatch, and r/Coronavirus, and postings between subreddits r/opiates, r/OpiatesRecovery, r/addiction, and r/Coronavirus from January 2020 - October 2020. Our results show a high topical correlation between postings in r/depression and r/Coronavirus in September 2020. Further, the topical correlation between postings on substance use disorders and Coronavirus fluctuates, showing the highest correlation in August 2020. By monitoring these trends from platforms such as Reddit, epidemiologists, and mental health professionals can gain insights into the challenges faced by communities for targeted interventions."

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly around the world, causing countries to impose lockdowns and efforts to develop vaccines on a global scale. However, human-to-animal and animal-to-human transmission cannot be ignored, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can spread rapidly in farmed and wild animals. This could create a worrying cycle of SARS-CoV-2 spillover from humans to animals and spillback of new strains back into humans, rendering vaccines ineffective. This study provides a key indicator of animals that may be potential susceptible hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus infections by analysing the phylogenetic distance between host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the coronavirus spike protein. Crucially, our analysis identifies animals that are at elevated risk from a spillover and spillback incident. One group of animals has been identified as potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 by harbouring a parasitic coronavirus spike protein similar to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These animals may serve as amplification hosts in spillover events from zoonotic reservoirs. Tracing interspecies transmission in multi-host environments based solely on in vitro and in vivo examinations of animal susceptibility or serology is a time-consuming task. This approach allows rapid identification of high-risk animals to prioritize research and assessment of the risk of zoonotic disease transmission in the environment. It is a tool to rapidly identify zoonotic species that may cause outbreaks or participate in expansion cycles of coexistence with their hosts. This prevents the spread of coronavirus infections between species, preventing spillover and spillback incidents from occurring."

We use a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigram, bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected Tweets. Popular unigrams include \"virus,\" \"lockdown,\" and \"quarantine.\" Popular bigrams include \"COVID-19,\" \"stay home,\" \"corona virus,\" \"social distancing,\" and \"new cases.\" We identify 13 discussion topics and categorize them into five different themes, such as \"public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19,\" \"social stigma associated with COVID-19,\" \"coronavirus news cases and deaths,\" \"COVID-19 in the United States,\" and \"coronavirus cases in the rest of the world\". Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of coronavirus are anticipation that measures that can be taken, followed by a mixed feeling of trust, anger, and fear for different topics. The public reveals a significant feeling of fear when they discuss the coronavirus new cases and deaths than other topics. The study shows that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for infodemiology study by studying the evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19. Real-time monitoring and assessment of the Twitter discussion and concerns can be promising for public health emergency responses and planning. Already emerged pandemic fear, stigma, and mental health concerns may continue to influence public trust when there occurs a second wave of COVID-19 or a new surge of the imminent pandemic."

Although, the scientists, researchers and doctors are working round the clock to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, it may take a year or two to make a safe and effective vaccine available for the world. In current circumstances, a solution must be developed to control or stop the spread of the virus. For this purpose, a novel technique based on call data record analysis (CDRA)and contact tracing is proposed that can effectively control the coronavirus outbreak. A positive coronavirus patient can be traced through CDRA and contact tracing. The technique can track the path traversed by the patient and collect the cell numbers of all those people who have met with the patient. Keeping in tact the privacy of this group of people, who are contacted through their cell numbers so that they can isolate themselves till the result of their coronavirus test arrives. If a test result of a person comes positive among the group, then he/she must be isolated and same CDRA and contact tracing procedures are adopted for that person. A COVID-19 patient is geo tagged and alerts are sent if any violation of isolation is done by the patient. Moreover, the general public is informed in advance to avoid the path followed by the patients. This cost effective mechanism is not only capable to control the coronavirus outbreak but also helps in isolating the patient in his/her house."

The structure is a truncated octahedron that accommodates two layers: an outer shell composed of triangular and quadrangular lattices of the N-terminal domain and an inner shell of equivalent lattices of coiled parallel helices of the C-terminal domain. The model is consistent with the dimensions expected for packaging large viral genomes and provides a rationale to interpret the apparent pleomorphic nature of coronaviruses."

We identify a new first stage of infection that precedes structural rearrangements by using biomolecular evolutionary theory to identify sequence differences enhancing viral attachment rates. We find a small cluster of four single mutations which show that CoV-2 has a new feature that promotes much stronger viral attachment and enhances contagiousness. The extremely dangerous dynamics of human coronavirus infection is a dramatic example of evolutionary approach of self-organized networks to criticality. It may favor a very successful vaccine. The identified mutations can be used to test the present theory experimentally. The theory also works well for the newer strains and explains their increased contagiousness."

            "text": "We comparatively analyzed the spatiotemporal fluctuations of the 2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS outbreaks to understand their epidemiological characteristics. Methodologically, we introduced TPL (Taylor power law) to characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability and Hubbell (2001) unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) [specifically Harris et al. (2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)] to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections, suggesting their potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter (M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds (COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M0 measures the infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M0 coincides or below the level of Allee effects. It was found that COVID-19 outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters {\\theta} and M, borrowed from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of infection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health interventions."

This study explores the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor worldwide interest in this COVID-19 epidemic. GT was chosen as a source of reverse engineering data, given the interest in the topic. Current data on COVID-19 is retrieved from (GT) using one main search topic: Coronavirus. Geographical settings for GT are worldwide, China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. The reported period is 15 January 2020 to 24 March 2020. The results show that the highest worldwide peak in the first wave of demand for information was on 31 January 2020. After the first peak, the number of new cases reported daily rose for 6 days. A second wave started on 21 February 2020 after the outbreaks were reported in Italy, with the highest peak on 16 March 2020. The second wave is six times as big as the first wave. The number of new cases reported daily is rising day by day. This short communication gives a brief introduction to how the demand for information on coronavirus epidemic is reported through GT."

We analyzed conserved domains of the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV2] for possible targets of viral entry inhibition in host cells, evolutionary relationship of human coronavirus [229E] and zoonotic coronaviruses with SAR-CoV2 as well as evolutionary relationship between selected SARS-CoV 2 genomic data. Conserved domains with antagonistic action on host innate antiviral cellular mechanisms in SARS-CoV 2 include nsp 11, nsp 13 etc. Also, multiple sequence alignments of the spike [S] gene protein of selected candidate zoonotic coronaviruses alongside the S gene protein of the SARs-CoV2 revealed closest evolutionary relationship [95.6%] with pangolin coronaviruses [S] gene. Clades formed between Wuhan SARS-CoV2 phylogeny data and five others suggests viral entry trajectory while revealing genomic and protein SARS CoV 2 data from Philippines as early ancestors. Therefore, phylogeny of SARS-CoV 2 genomic data suggests profiling in diverse populations with and without the outbreak alongside migration history and racial background for mutation tracking and dating of viral subtype divergence which is essential for effective management of present and future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks."

In this research article, we identify public sentiment associated with the pandemic using Coronavirus specific Tweets and R statistical software, along with its sentiment analysis packages. We demonstrate insights into the progress of fear-sentiment over time as COVID-19 approached peak levels in the United States, using descriptive textual analytics supported by necessary textual data visualizations. Furthermore, we provide a methodological overview of two essential machine learning (ML) classification methods, in the context of textual analytics, and compare their effectiveness in classifying Coronavirus Tweets of varying lengths. We observe a strong classification accuracy of 91% for short Tweets, with the Naive Bayes method. We also observe that the logistic regression classification method provides a reasonable accuracy of 74% with shorter Tweets, and both methods showed relatively weaker performance for longer Tweets. This research provides insights into Coronavirus fear sentiment progression, and outlines associated methods, implications, limitations and opportunities."

Nearly 6000 deaths have been recorded due mainly to COVID-19 outbreak worldwide and more than 50% of these deaths appeared to have evolved from China where the virus was thought to originate. The endemicity of COVID-19 dramatically surpassed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that were so far discovered in 2003 and 2012 respectively. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak not only a public health emergency but also pandemic in nature. Currently, over 120 countries including Nigeria were reported to have more than 157,844 confirmed cases and 5,846 deaths due mainly to COVID-19 outbreak as of March 15, 2020, 10:55 GMT. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely used to aid in the prediction, detection, response, recovery of disease and making clinical diagnosis.

In particular, two \"new\" communities, /r/China flu and /r/Coronavirus, emerged on Reddit and have been dedicated to COVID- related discussions from the very beginning of this pandemic. With /r/Coronavirus promoted as the official community on Reddit, it remains an open question how users choose between these two highly-related communities.   In this paper, we characterize user trajectories in these two communities from the beginning of COVID-19 to the end of September 2020. We show that new users of /r/China flu and /r/Coronavirus were similar from January to March. After that, their differences steadily increase, evidenced by both language distance and membership prediction, as the pandemic continues to unfold. Furthermore, users who started at /r/China flu from January to March were more likely to leave, while those who started in later months tend to remain highly \"loyal\". To understand this difference, we develop a movement analysis framework to understand membership changes in these two communities and identify a significant proportion of /r/China flu members (around 50%) that moved to /r/Coronavirus in February. This movement turns out to be highly predictable based on other subreddits that users were previously active in. Our work demonstrates how two highly-related communities emerge and develop their own identity in a crisis, and highlights the important role of existing communities in understanding such an emergence."

People around the world have taken to social media to express their opinions and general emotions regarding this phenomenon that has taken over the world by storm. The social networking site, Twitter showed an unprecedented increase in tweets related to the novel Coronavirus in a very short span of time. This paper presents the global sentiment analysis of tweets related to Coronavirus and how the sentiment of people in different countries has changed over time. Furthermore, to determine the impact of Coronavirus on daily aspects of life, tweets related to Work From Home (WFH) and Online Learning were scraped and the change in sentiment over time was observed. In addition, various Machine Learning models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were implemented for sentiment classification and their accuracies were determined. Exploratory data analysis was also performed for a dataset providing information about the number of confirmed cases on a per-day basis in a few of the worst-hit countries to provide a comparison between the change in sentiment with the change in cases since the start of this pandemic till June 2020."

In 2020, coronavirus-related publications grew by 20 times over the previous two years, with 130,000 more researchers publishing on related topics. The United States, the United Kingdom and China led dozens of nations working on coronavirus prior to the pandemic, but leadership consolidated among these three nations in 2020, which collectively accounted for 50% of all papers, garnering well more than 60% of citations. China took an early lead on COVID-19 research, but dropped rapidly in production and international participation through the year. Europe showed an opposite pattern, beginning slowly in publications but growing in contributions during the year. The share of internationally collaborative publications dropped from pre-pandemic rates; single-authored publications grew. For all nations, including China, the number of publications about COVID track closely with the outbreak of COVID-19 cases. Lower-income nations participate very little in COVID-19 research in 2020. Topic maps of internationally collaborative work show the rise of patient care and public health clusters, two topics that were largely absent from coronavirus research in the two years prior to 2020. Findings are consistent with global science as a self-organizing system operating on a reputation-based dynamic."

The oil price reaction to COVID-19 was gradually accommodated until March 09, 2020, when, 49 days after the release of the first coronavirus monitoring report by the World Health Organization (WHO), Saudi Arabia floods the market with oil. As a result, international prices drop with more than 20% in one single day. Against this background, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 numbers on crude oil prices, while controlling for the impact of financial volatility and the United States (US) economic policy uncertainty. Our ARDL estimation shows that the COVID-19 daily reported cases of new infections have a marginal negative impact on the crude oil prices in the long run. Nevertheless, by amplifying the financial markets volatility, COVID-19 also has an indirect effect on the recent dynamics of crude oil prices."

More than 125000 confirmed cases and 4,607 death cases have been recorded around more than 118 countries. Unfortunately, a coronavirus vaccine is expected to take at least 18 months if it works at all. Moreover, COVID -19 epidemics can mutate into a more aggressive form. Day level information about the COVID -19 spread is crucial to measure the behavior of this new virus globally. Therefore, this study presents a comparison of day level forecasting models on COVID-19 affected cases using time series models and mathematical formulation. The forecasting models and data strongly suggest that the number of coronavirus cases grows exponentially in countries that do not mandate quarantines, restrictions on travel and public gatherings, and closing of schools, universities, and workplaces (Social Distancing)."

The virus has gone through various pathways of evolution. For understanding the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. We present an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The SNP genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. Our method serves a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their gradual and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control."

The parameters of the logistics equation for Russia, Moscow and other large regions were determined in the interval (01.03 - 08.04). A comparative analysis of growth rates of COVID-19 infected population for different countries and regions is presented. Various scenarios of the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus in Moscow and in the regions of Russia are considered. For each scenario, curves for the daily new cases and graphs for the increase in the total number of cases were obtained, and the dynamics of infection spread by day was studied. Peak times, epidemic periods, the number of infected people at the peak and their growth were determined."

Social media is playing an important role in news propagation as well as keeping people in contact. At the same time, this source is both a blessing and a curse as the coronavirus infodemic has become a major concern, and is already a topic that needs special attention and further research. In this paper, we provide a multilingual coronavirus (COVID-19) Instagram dataset that we have been continuously collected since March 30, 2020. We are making our dataset available to the research community at Github. We believe that this contribution will help the community to better understand the dynamics behind this phenomenon in Instagram, as one of the major social media. This dataset could also help study the propagation of misinformation related to this outbreak."

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 had been sequenced and structurally annotated, yet little is known of the intrinsic organization and evolution of the genome. To this end, we present a mathematical method for the genomic spectrum, a kind of barcode, of SARS-CoV-2 and common human coronaviruses. The genomic spectrum is constructed according to the periodic distributions of nucleotides, and therefore reflects the unique characteristics of the genome. The results demonstrate that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exhibits dinucleotide TT islands in the non-structural proteins 3, 4, 5, and 6. Further analysis of the dinucleotide regions suggests that the dinucleotide repeats are increased during evolution and may confer the evolutionary fitness of the virus. The special dinucleotide regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome identified in this study may become diagnostic and pharmaceutical targets in monitoring and curing the COVID-19 disease."

Given the increasing caseload and uncertainty of spread, there is an urgent need to develop machine learning techniques to predict the spread of COVID-19. Prediction of the spread can allow counter measures and actions to be implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a deep learning technique, called Deep Sequential Prediction Model (DSPM) and machine learning based Non-parametric Regression Model (NRM) to predict the spread of COVID-19. Our proposed models were trained and tested on novel coronavirus 2019 dataset, which contains 19.53 Million confirmed cases of COVID-19. Our proposed models were evaluated by using Mean Absolute Error and compared with baseline method. Our experimental results, both quantitative and qualitative, demonstrate the superior prediction performance of the proposed models."

Cell infection begins when the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with the cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we address the role of Tetracycline as an inhibitor for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Targeted molecular investigation show that Tetracycline binds more favorably to the RBD (-9.40 kcal/mol) compared to Chloroquine (-6.31 kcal/mol) or Doxycycline (-8.08 kcal/mol) and inhibits attachment to ACE2 to a greater degree (binding efficiency of 2.98 $\\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{mol}\\cdot \\text{nm}^2}$ for Tetracycline-RBD, 5.59 $\\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{mol}\\cdot \\text{nm}^2}$ for Chloroquine-RBD, 5.16 $\\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{mol}\\cdot \\text{nm}^2}$ for Doxycycline-RBD). Stronger Tetracycline inhibition is verified with nonequilibrium PMF calculations, for which the Tetracycline-RBD complex exhibits the lowest free energy profile along the dissociation pathway from ACE2. Tetracycline appears to target viral residues that are usually involved in significant hydrogen bonding with ACE2; this inhibition of cellular infection complements the anti-inflammatory and cytokine suppressing capability of Tetracycline, and may further reduce the duration of ICU stays and mechanical ventilation induced by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2."

As a response to the pandemic, the international network for coronavirus research expanded rapidly along the hierarchical structure laid out by the global health science network. Thus, in face of the crisis, the global health science system proved to be structurally stable yet versatile in research. The observed versatility supports optimistic views on the role of science in meeting future challenges. However, the stability of the global core-periphery structure may be worrying, because it reduces learning opportunities and social capital of scientifically peripheral countries -- not only during this pandemic but also in its \"normal\" mode of operation."

We identify the lead-lag relationship between oil and stock prices, and the intensity of this relationship at different frequency cycles and moments in time. Our unique findings show that co-movements between oil and stock prices manifest at 3-5-day cycle and are stronger in the first part of March and the second part of April 2020, when oil prices are leading stock prices. The partial wavelet coherence analysis, controlling for the effect of COVID-19 and US economic policy-induced uncertainty, reveals that the coronavirus crisis amplifies the shock propagation between oil and stock prices."

However, there are some laybacks can be considered regarding to this diagnostic method, such as time consuming and low accuracy. As a relatively large organ of human body, important spatial features would be lost if the lungs were diagnosed utilizing two dimensional slice image. Therefore, in this paper, a deep learning model with 3D image was designed.

Is there any physical invariant in the variants of such kind of pathogen that could be taken advantage to ease the tensions? To this point, extensive numerical experiments based on continuity mechanics were carried out to discover the vibration modes and the range of natural frequency of coronavirus Covid-19. Such invariant could help us in developing some flexible technique to deactivate the coronavirus, like as resonantly breaking the viral spike by ultrasound wave. The fundamental mechanisms governing such process are demonstrated via solving the coupled equations of acoustics and dynamics and thereafter the technique strategies proposed to efficiently realize the concept."

This paper investigates how pandemic visualizations circulated on social media, and shows that people who mistrust the scientific establishment often deploy the same rhetorics of data-driven decision-making used by experts, but to advocate for radical policy changes. Using a quantitative analysis of how visualizations spread on Twitter and an ethnographic approach to analyzing conversations about COVID data on Facebook, we document an epistemological gap that leads pro- and anti-mask groups to draw drastically different inferences from similar data. Ultimately, we argue that the deployment of COVID data visualizations reflect a deeper sociopolitical rift regarding the place of science in public life."

We proposed in a first step to improve the multiwavelet notion by constructing more general families using independent components for multi-scaling and multiwavelet mother functions. A special multiwavelet is then introduced, continuous and discrete multiwavelet transforms are associated, as well as new filters and algorithms of decomposition and reconstruction. The constructed multiwavelet framework is applied for some experimentations showing fast algorithms, ECG signal, and a strain of Coronavirus processing."

Being dealt with area normalization method, the fitting curves could be regarded as a kind of probability density function (PDF), its mathematical expectation and the variance could be used to analyze the situation of the coronavirus pandemic. Numerical experiments based on the data of certain countries have indicated that the QDF method demonstrate the intrinsic characteristics of COVID-19 data of the given country or distric, and because of the interval of data used in this paper is over one year (500 days), it reveals the fact that after multi-wave transmission of the coronavirus, the case fatality rate has declined obviously, the result shows that as an appraisal method, it is effective and feasible."

Using the proposed approach, we achieve an overall accuracy of $93\\%$ on the coronavirus variant identification task. We also provide details regarding how the proposed model follows the main laws of federated learning, such as Laws of data ownership, data privacy, model aggregation, and model heterogeneity.

            "text": "The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic disease spreading rapidly around the world. A robust and automatic early recognition of COVID-19, via auxiliary computer-aided diagnostic tools, is essential for disease cure and control. The chest radiography images, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and X-ray, and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can be a significant and useful material for designing such tools. However, designing such an automated tool is challenging as a massive number of manually annotated datasets are not publicly available yet, which is the core requirement of supervised learning systems. In this article, we propose a robust CNN-based network, called CVR-Net (Coronavirus Recognition Network), for the automatic recognition of the coronavirus from CT or X-ray images. The proposed end-to-end CVR-Net is a multi-scale-multi-encoder ensemble model, where we have aggregated the outputs from two different encoders and their different scales to obtain the final prediction probability. We train and test the proposed CVR-Net on three different datasets, where the images have collected from different open-source repositories. We compare our proposed CVR-Net with state-of-the-art methods, which are trained and tested on the same datasets. We split three datasets into five different tasks, where each task has a different number of classes, to evaluate the multi-tasking CVR-Net. Our model achieves an overall F1-score & accuracy of 0.997 & 0.998; 0.963 & 0.964; 0.816 & 0.820; 0.961 & 0.961; and 0.780 & 0.780, respectively, for task-1 to task-5. As the CVR-Net provides promising results on the small datasets, it can be an auspicious computer-aided diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of coronavirus to assist the clinical practitioners and radiologists. Our source codes and model are publicly available at https://github.com/kamruleee51/CVR-Net."

Designing and monitoring interventions to slow and stop the spread of the virus require knowledge of how many people have been and are currently infected, where they live, and how they interact. The first step is an accurate assessment of the population prevalence of past infections. There are very few population-representative prevalence studies of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and only two American states -- Indiana and Connecticut -- have reported probability-based sample surveys that characterize state-wide prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. One of the difficulties is the fact that the tests to detect and characterize SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus antibodies are new, not well characterized, and generally function poorly. During July, 2020, a survey representing all adults in the State of Ohio in the United States collected biomarkers and information on protective behavior related to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Several features of the survey make it difficult to estimate past prevalence: 1) a low response rate, 2) very low number of positive cases, and 3) the fact that multiple, poor quality serological tests were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We describe a new Bayesian approach for analyzing the biomarker data that simultaneously addresses these challenges and characterizes the potential effect of selective response. The model does not require survey sample weights, accounts for multiple, imperfect antibody test results, and characterizes uncertainty related to the sample survey and the multiple, imperfect, potentially correlated tests."

To better understand viral tropism, we assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy."

Therefore, it is necessary to implement an automatic detection system as a quick alternative diagnosis option to prevent COVID-19 spreading among people. In this study, five pre-trained convolutional neural network based models (ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2) have been proposed for the detection of coronavirus pneumonia infected patient using chest X-ray radiographs. We have implemented three different binary classifications with four classes (COVID-19, normal (healthy), viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia) by using 5-fold cross validation. Considering the performance results obtained, it has seen that the pre-trained ResNet50 model provides the highest classification performance (96.1% accuracy for Dataset-1, 99.5% accuracy for Dataset-2 and 99.7% accuracy for Dataset-3) among other four used models."

Here we report a distant sequence similarity between the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail of the coronavirus spike protein and the hepcidin protein that is found in humans and other vertebrates. Hepcidin is thought to be the key regulator of iron metabolism in humans. An implication of this preliminary observation is to suggest a potential route of investigation in the coronavirus research field making use of an already-established literature on the interplay of local and systemic iron regulation, cytokine-mediated inflammatory processes, respiratory infections and the hepcidin protein. The question of possible homology and an evolutionary connection between the viral spike protein and hepcidin is not assessed in this report, but some scenarios for its study are discussed."

For many whose distant ancestors moved to temperate climes, these adaptations proved harmful: pigmentation decreased by natural selection and susceptibility to hypertension emerged. Now an added risk is lung inflammation from coronavirus that may be furthered by innate immune differences. Hypertension and coronavirus have in common angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which decreases blood pressure and mediates virus entry. In keeping with less detailed studies, a long-term case-report shows that decreased blood pressure induced by blocking a primary angiotensin receptor is supplemented, above critical blocker dosage, by a further temperature-dependent fall, likely mediated by ACE2 and secondary angiotensin receptors. Temperature-dependence suggests a linkage with tropical heritage and an influence of blockers on the progress of coronavirus infections. Positive therapeutic results should result from negation of host pro-inflammatory effects mediated by the primary angiotensin receptor and concomitant promotion of countervailing anti-inflammatory effects mediated by ACE2 through other receptors. These effects may involve innate immune system components (lectin complement pathway, NAD metabolome). Black vulnerability - more likely based on physiological than on socioeconomic differences - provides an important clue that may guide treatments."

Here we report a pre-registered online experiment (N=2,459) using a heterogenous, although not representative, sample of people living in the USA, where we test the relative effect of messages highlighting that the coronavirus is a threat to \"you\" vs \"your family\" vs \"your community\" vs \"your country\" on self-reported intentions to wear a face covering. Results show that focusing on \"your community\" promotes intentions to wear a face covering relative to the baseline; the trend is the same when comparing \"your community\" to the other conditions, but not significant. We also conducted pre-registered analyses of gender differences on intentions to wear a face covering. We find that men less than women intend to wear a face covering, but this difference almost disappears in counties where wearing a face covering is mandatory. We also find that men less than women believe that they will be seriously affected by the coronavirus, and this partly mediates gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering (this is particularly ironic because official statistics actually show that men are affected by the COVID-19 more seriously than women). Finally, we also find gender differences in self-reported negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering. Men more than women agree that wearing a face covering is shameful, not cool, a sign of weakness, and a stigma; and these gender differences also mediate gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering."

That is to say, asymptomatic patients are the main factor behind the large quick spreading of coronavirus and are also the major reason that caused governments to lose control over this critical situation. To contribute to remedying this global pandemic, in this paper, we propose an IoT (Internet of Things) investigation system that was specifically designed to spot both undocumented patients and infectious places. The goal is to help the authorities to disinfect high-contamination sites and confine persons even if they have no apparent symptoms. The proposed system also allows determining all persons who had close contact with infected or suspected patients. Consequently, rapid isolation of suspicious cases and more efficient control over any pandemic propagation can be achieved."

The statistical analysis here focuses on case study of Italy, one of the countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. Results reveal two main findings: 1) cities in regions with high wind speed and a high wind energy production in MW have a lower number of infected individuals of COVID-19 infection and total deaths; 2) cities located in hinterland zones (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with high polluting industrialization, low wind speed and less cleaner production have a greater number of infected individuals and total deaths. Hence, cities with pollution industrialization and low renewable energy have also to consider low wind speed and other climatological factors that can increase stagnation of the air in the atmosphere with potential problems for public health in the presence of viral agents. Results here suggest that current pandemic of Coronavirus disease and future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection cannot be solved only with research and practice of medicine, immunology and microbiology but also with a proactive strategy directed to interventions for a sustainable development. Overall, then, this study has to conclude that a strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection must also be based on sustainability science to support a higher level of renewable energy and cleaner production to reduce polluting industrialization and, as result, the factors determining the spread of coronavirus disease and other infections in society."

In a desperate effort to discover new drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, many scientists are working around the clock. Their valuable time and effort may benefit from computer-based mining of a large volume of health science literature that is a treasure trove of information. In this paper, we have developed a graph-based model using abstracts of 10,683 scientific articles to find key information on three topics: transmission, drug types, and genome research related to coronavirus. A subgraph is built for each of the three topics to extract more topic-focused information. Within each subgraph, we use a betweenness centrality measurement to rank order the importance of keywords related to drugs, diseases, pathogens, hosts of pathogens, and biomolecules. The results reveal intriguing information about antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Amantadine, Dexamethasone), pathogen-hosts (pigs, bats, macaque, cynomolgus), viral pathogens (zika, dengue, malaria, and several viruses in the coronaviridae virus family), and proteins and therapeutic mechanisms (oligonucleotide, interferon, glycoprotein) in connection with the core topic of coronavirus. The categorical summary of these keywords and topics may be a useful reference to expedite and recommend new and alternative directions for COVID-19 research."

The course of this pandemic will be largely shaped by how governments enact timely policies, disseminate the information, and most importantly, how the public reacts to them. Here, we examine informationseeking responses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state. By using an eventstudy framework, we show that such news increases collective attention to the crisis right away, but the elevated level of attention is short-lived, even though the initial announcements were followed by increasingly strong measures. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms and hand sanitizer. On the other hand, searches for information regarding community level policies (e.g., quarantine, school closures, testing), or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports. These results are encouraging given our study period is relatively early in the epidemic and more elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse. Further analysis will track evolving patterns of responses to subsequent flows of public information."

Following that notion, we have developed a model and then employed it for forecasting future COVID-19 cases in India. The study indicates an ascending trend for the cases in the coming days.

As it currently spreading in the United States, policy makers, public health officials and citizens are racing to understand the impact of this virus on the United States healthcare system. They fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm the healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as social distancing, to decrease the rate of newly infected people, i.e. flattening the curve.In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of the number of people hospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory. Given that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the theory of infinite server queues with non-stationary Poisson arrival rates. With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how flattening the curve impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time of the peak demand for the hospital resources. Finally, we present empirical evidence from China, South Korea, Italy and the United States that supports the insights from the model."

In this work, we present ReCOVery, a repository designed and constructed to facilitate research on combating such information regarding COVID-19. We first broadly search and investigate ~2,000 news publishers, from which 60 are identified with extreme [high or low] levels of credibility. By inheriting the credibility of the media on which they were published, a total of 2,029 news articles on coronavirus, published from January to May 2020, are collected in the repository, along with 140,820 tweets that reveal how these news articles have spread on the Twitter social network. The repository provides multimodal information of news articles on coronavirus, including textual, visual, temporal, and network information. The way that news credibility is obtained allows a trade-off between dataset scalability and label accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to present data statistics and distributions, as well as to provide baseline performances for predicting news credibility so that future methods can be compared.

The unavailability of specific medications to treat COVID-19 has led to drug repositioning efforts using various approaches, including computational analyses. Such analyses mostly rely on molecular docking and require the 3D structure of the target protein to be available. In this study, we utilized a set of machine learning algorithms and trained them on a dataset of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors to run inference analyses on antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs solely based on the ligand information. We also performed virtual screening analysis of the drug candidates predicted by machine learning models and docked them against the active site of SARS- CoV-2 RdRp, a key component of the virus replication machinery. Based on the ligand information of RdRp inhibitors, the machine learning models were able to identify candidates such as remdesivir and baloxavir marboxil, molecules with documented activity against RdRp of the novel coronavirus. Among the other identified drug candidates were beclabuvir, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RdRp enzyme, and HCV protease inhibitors paritaprevir and faldaprevir. Further analysis of these candidates using molecular docking against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp revealed low binding energies against the enzyme active site. Our approach also identified anti-inflammatory drugs lupeol, lifitegrast, antrafenine, betulinic acid, and ursolic acid to have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We propose that the results of this study are considered for further validation as potential therapeutic options against COVID-19."

Currently there is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and so, there is an urgent need for expedite discovery of new therapeutics to combat the disease until a vaccine will be available worldwide. Drug repurposing is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved drugs that has the advantage (over conventional approaches that attempt to develop a drug from scratch) that time frame of the overall process can be significantly reduced because of the few number of clinical trial required. In this work, a virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs was performed for repositioning as potential inhibitors of the main protease Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. As a result of this study, 12 drugs are proposed as candidates for inhibitors of the Mpro enzyme. Some of the selected compounds are antiviral drugs that are already being tested in COVID-19 clinical trials (i.e. ribavirin) or are used to alleviate symptoms of the disease (i.e. codeine). Surprisingly, the most promising candidate is the naturally occurring broad spectrum antibiotic oxytetracycline. This compound has largely outperformed the remaining selected candidates along all filtering steps of our virtual screening protocol. If the activity of any of these drugs is experimentally corroborated, they could be used directly in clinical trials without the need for pre-clinical testing or safety evaluation since they are already used as drugs for other diseases."

To conduct the study, data on mobility patterns, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of people, lockdown measures, and coronavirus pandemic were collected from multiple sources (e.g., Google, UNDP, UN, BBC, Oxford University, Worldometer). A Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique is used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on dependent variables considering the intervening effects of mediators. Results show that lockdown measures have significant effects to encourage people to maintain social distancing. However, pandemic severity and socioeconomic and institutional factors have limited effects to sustain social distancing practice. The results also explain that socioeconomic and institutional factors of urbanity and modernity have significant effects on pandemic severity. Countries with a higher number of elderly people, employment in the service sector, and higher globalization trend are the worst victims of the coronavirus pandemic (e.g., USA, UK, Italy, and Spain). Social distancing measures are reasonably effective at tempering the severity of the pandemic."

Countries irrespective of economic status have succumbed to this pandemic. Many aspects of the lives, including health, economy, freedom of movement have been negatively affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Numerous strategies have been taken in order to prevent the outbreak. Some countries took severe resections in the form of full-scale lockdown, while others took a moderate approach of dealing with the pandemics, for example, mass testing, prohibiting large-scale public gatherings, restricting international travels. South America adopted primarily the lockdown strategies due to inadequate economy and health care support. Since the social interactions between the people are primarily affected by the lockdown, psychological distress, e.g. anxiety, stress, fear are supposedly affecting the South American population in a severe way. This paper aims to explore the impact of lockdown over the psychological aspect of the people of all the Spanish speaking South American capitals. We have utilized infodemiology approach by employing large-scale Twitter data-set over 33 million feeds in order to understand people's interaction over the months of this on-going coronavirus pandemic. Our result is surprising: at the beginning of the pandemic, people demonstrated strong emotions (i.e. anxiety, worry, fear) which declined over time even though the actual pandemic is worsening by having more positive cases, and inflicting more deaths. This leads us to speculate that the South American population is adapting to this pandemic thus improving the overall psychological distress."

            "text": "With the continued spread of coronavirus, the task of forecasting distinctive COVID-19 growth curves in different cities, which remain inadequately explained by standard epidemiological models, is critical for medical supply and treatment. Predictions must take into account non-pharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of coronavirus, including stay-at-home orders, social distancing, quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing, leading to reductions in intra-city mobility and viral transmission. Moreover, recent work associating coronavirus with human mobility and detailed movement data suggest the need to consider urban mobility in disease forecasts. Here we show that by incorporating intra-city mobility and policy adoption into a novel metapopulation SEIR model, we can accurately predict complex COVID-19 growth patterns in U.S. cities ($R^2$ = 0.990). Estimated mobility change due to policy interventions is consistent with empirical observation from Apple Mobility Trends Reports (Pearson's R = 0.872), suggesting the utility of model-based predictions where data are limited. Our model also reproduces urban \"superspreading\", where a few neighborhoods account for most secondary infections across urban space, arising from uneven neighborhood populations and heightened intra-city churn in popular neighborhoods. Therefore, our model can facilitate location-aware mobility reduction policy that more effectively mitigates disease transmission at similar social cost. Finally, we demonstrate our model can serve as a fine-grained analytic and simulation framework that informs the design of rational non-pharmaceutical interventions policies."

People and authorities resort to social media platforms the most to share awareness information and voice out their opinions due to their massive outreach in spreading the word in practically no time. People use a number of languages to communicate over social media platforms based on their familiarity, language outreach, and availability on social media platforms. The entire world has been hit by the coronavirus and India is the second worst-hit country in terms of the number of active coronavirus cases. India, being a multilingual country, offers a great opportunity to study the outreach of various languages that have been actively used across social media platforms. In this study, we aim to study the dataset related to COVID-19 collected in the period between February 2020 to July 2020 specifically for regional languages in India.

Fortunately, many countries and companies have started to develop coronavirus vaccines since the beginning of this disaster. Till now, more than 20 vaccines have been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), bringing light to people besieged by the pandemic. The promotion of COVID-19 vaccination around the world also brings a lot of discussions on social media about different aspects of vaccines, such as efficacy and security. However, there does not exist much research work to systematically analyze public opinion towards COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of tweets related to the coronavirus vaccine on Twitter to understand the trending topics and their corresponding sentimental polarities regarding the country and vaccine levels. The results show that a majority of people are confident in the effectiveness of vaccines and are willing to get vaccinated. In contrast, the negative tweets are often associated with the complaints of vaccine shortages, side effects after injections and possible death after being vaccinated. Overall, this study exploits popular NLP and topic modeling methods to mine people's opinions on the COVID-19 vaccines on social media and to analyse and visualise them objectively. Our findings can improve the readability of the noisy information on social media and provide effective data support for the government and policy makers."

As of July 2020, no specific drugs or vaccines are yet available for COVID-19, fast and accurate diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 is essential in slowing down the spread of COVID-19 and for efficient implementation of control and containment strategies. Magnetic immunoassay is a novel and emerging topic representing the frontiers of current biosensing and magnetics areas. The past decade has seen rapid growth in applying magnetic tools for biological and biomedical applications. Recent advances in magnetic materials and nanotechnologies have transformed current diagnostic methods to nanoscale and pushed the detection limit to early stage disease diagnosis. Herein, this review covers the literatures of magnetic immunoassay platforms for virus and pathogen detections, before COVID-19. We reviewed the popular magnetic immunoassay platforms including magnetoresistance (MR) sensors, magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Magnetic Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostic kits are also reviewed aiming at developing plug-and-play diagnostics to manage the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as well as preventing future epidemics. In addition, other platforms that use magnetic materials as auxiliary tools for enhanced pathogen and virus detections are also covered. The goal of this review is to inform the researchers of diagnostic and surveillance platforms for SARS-CoV-2 and their performances."

            "text": "As a result of the worldwide transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an unprecedented pandemic. Currently, with unavailable pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines, this novel coronavirus results in a great impact on public health, human society, and global economy, which is likely to last for many years. One of the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that a long-term system with non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing and controlling new infectious diseases is desirable to be implemented. Internet of things (IoT) platform is preferred to be utilized to achieve this goal, due to its ubiquitous sensing ability and seamless connectivity. IoT technology is changing our lives through smart healthcare, smart home, and smart city, which aims to build a more convenient and intelligent community. This paper presents how the IoT could be incorporated into the epidemic prevention and control system. Specifically, we demonstrate a potential fog-cloud combined IoT platform that can be used in the systematic and intelligent COVID-19 prevention and control, which involves five interventions including COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis, Quarantine Monitoring, Contact Tracing & Social Distancing, COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting, and SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking. We investigate and review the state-of-the-art literatures of these five interventions to present the capabilities of IoT in countering against the current COVID-19 pandemic or future infectious disease epidemics."
