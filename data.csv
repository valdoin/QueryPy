100	What Risk Factors to Cause Long COVID and Its Impact on Patient Survival   Outcomes when Combined with the Effect from Organ Transplantation in the   Acute COVID. Coronavirus disease 2019 in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients is associated with more severe outcomes than non-immunosuppressed hosts. However, exactly which risk factors cause Long COVID in acute COVID cases remains unknown. More importantly, the impact of Long COVID on patient survival remains understudied, especially when examined alongside the effect of SOT. All patients have been identified with acute COVID in the National COVID Collaborative Cohort registry. We compared patient demographics in Long COVID vs. those without Long COVID based on descriptive statistics. Multivariable logistics regressions were used to determine the factors related to the likelihood of developing Long COVID from a case of acute COVID. Multi-variables Cox regression was used to determine the time-to-event outcome of patient survival with Long COVID. This study reviewed data from a cohort of 6,416,500 acute COVID patients. Of that group, 31,744 patients developed Long COVID from ICD diagnosis. The mean (q1, q3) age was 39 (22, 57) years old, and 55% of patients were female. From this cohort, a total of 31,744 (1%) developed Long COVID and 43,565 (1%) had SOT, with a total of 698 SOT patients identified with Long COVID. Mean age of those with Long COVID was 52 (39, 64) years old and 64% of patients were female. Most of the SOT patients were kidney transplant recipients. From the Cox regression analysis of patient survival, there were many significant factors related to patient survival, with elderly SOT patients having a much higher hazard ratio of 27.8 (26.3, 29.4). This study has identified the important risk factors that are more likely to cause Long COVID in an acute COVID cohort. We investigated hazard ratios of patient survival based on multivariable Cox models, which found that Long COVID had a more direct impact on survival in elderly patients and those with SOT.	Arxiv
101	COVID-Net MLSys: Designing COVID-Net for the Clinical Workflow. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to devastate globally, one promising field of research is machine learning-driven computer vision to streamline various parts of the COVID-19 clinical workflow. These machine learning methods are typically stand-alone models designed without consideration for the integration necessary for real-world application workflows. In this study, we take a machine learning and systems (MLSys) perspective to design a system for COVID-19 patient screening with the clinical workflow in mind. The COVID-Net system is comprised of the continuously evolving COVIDx dataset, COVID-Net deep neural network for COVID-19 patient detection, and COVID-Net S deep neural networks for disease severity scoring for COVID-19 positive patient cases. The deep neural networks within the COVID-Net system possess state-of-the-art performance, and are designed to be integrated within a user interface (UI) for clinical decision support with automatic report generation to assist clinicians in their treatment decisions.

102	COVID-19-CT-CXR: a freely accessible and weakly labeled chest X-ray and   CT image collection on COVID-19 from biomedical literature. The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the biomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset. We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. We also designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms and clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications. We believe that our work is complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset, code, and DL models are publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/COVID-19-CT-CXR.	Arxiv
103	COVID-Net UV: An End-to-End Spatio-Temporal Deep Neural Network   Architecture for Automated Diagnosis of COVID-19 Infection from Ultrasound   Videos. Besides vaccination, as an effective way to mitigate the further spread of COVID-19, fast and accurate screening of individuals to test for the disease is yet necessary to ensure public health safety. We propose COVID-Net UV, an end-to-end hybrid spatio-temporal deep neural network architecture, to detect COVID-19 infection from lung point-of-care ultrasound videos captured by convex transducers. COVID-Net UV comprises a convolutional neural network that extracts spatial features and a recurrent neural network that learns temporal dependence. After careful hyperparameter tuning, the network achieves an average accuracy of 94.44% with no false-negative cases for COVID-19 cases. The goal with COVID-Net UV is to assist front-line clinicians in the fight against COVID-19 via accelerating the screening of lung point-of-care ultrasound videos and automatic detection of COVID-19 positive cases.

104	Ensemble CNN models for Covid-19 Recognition and Severity Perdition From   3D CT-scan. Since the appearance of Covid-19 in late 2019, Covid-19 has become an active research topic for the artificial intelligence (AI) community. One of the most interesting AI topics is Covid-19 analysis of medical imaging. CT-scan imaging is the most informative tool about this disease. This work is part of the 2nd COV19D competition, where two challenges are set: Covid-19 Detection and Covid-19 Severity Detection from the CT-scans. For Covid-19 detection from CT-scans, we proposed an ensemble of 2D Convolution blocks with Densenet-161 models. Here, each 2D convolutional block with Densenet-161 architecture is trained separately and in testing phase, the ensemble model is based on the average of their probabilities. On the other hand, we proposed an ensemble of Convolutional Layers with Inception models for Covid-19 severity detection. In addition to the Convolutional Layers, three Inception variants were used, namely Inception-v3, Inception-v4 and Inception-Resnet. Our proposed approaches outperformed the baseline approach in the validation data of the 2nd COV19D competition by 11% and 16% for Covid-19 detection and Covid-19 severity detection, respectively.

105	Comprehensively identifying Long Covid articles with human-in-the-loop   machine learning. A significant percentage of COVID-19 survivors experience ongoing multisystemic symptoms that often affect daily living, a condition known as Long Covid or post-acute-sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, identifying scientific articles relevant to Long Covid is challenging since there is no standardized or consensus terminology. We developed an iterative human-in-the-loop machine learning framework combining data programming with active learning into a robust ensemble model, demonstrating higher specificity and considerably higher sensitivity than other methods. Analysis of the Long Covid collection shows that (1) most Long Covid articles do not refer to Long Covid by any name (2) when the condition is named, the name used most frequently in the literature is Long Covid, and (3) Long Covid is associated with disorders in a wide variety of body systems. The Long Covid collection is updated weekly and is searchable online at the LitCovid portal: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/docsum?filters=e_condition.LongCovid	Arxiv
106	Machine Learning-driven Analysis of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in   Post-COVID-19 Patients. The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has posed significant health challenges worldwide. While respiratory symptoms have been the primary focus, emerging evidence has highlighted the impact of COVID-19 on various organ systems, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This study, based on data from 913 post-COVID-19 patients in Iraq collected during 2022 and 2023, investigates the prevalence and patterns of GI symptoms in individuals recovering from COVID-19 and leverages machine learning algorithms to identify predictive factors for these symptoms. The research findings reveal that a notable percentage of post-COVID-19 patients experience GI symptoms during their recovery phase. Diarrhea emerged as the most frequently reported symptom, followed by abdominal pain and nausea. Machine learning analysis uncovered significant predictive factors for GI symptoms, including age, gender, disease severity, comorbidities, and the duration of COVID-19 illness. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring and addressing GI symptoms in post-COVID-19 care, with machine learning offering valuable tools for early identification and personalized intervention. This study contributes to the understanding of the long-term consequences of COVID-19 on GI health and emphasizes the potential benefits of utilizing machine learning-driven analysis in predicting and managing these symptoms. Further research is warranted to delve into the mechanisms underlying GI symptoms in COVID-19 survivors and to develop targeted interventions for symptom management. Keywords: COVID-19, gastrointestinal symptoms, machine learning, predictive factors, post-COVID-19 care, long COVID.	Arxiv
107	An Exploratory Characterization of Bugs in COVID-19 Software Projects. Context: The dire consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced development of COVID-19 software i.e., software used for analysis and mitigation of COVID-19. Bugs in COVID-19 software can be consequential, as COVID-19 software projects can impact public health policy and user data privacy. Objective: The goal of this paper is to help practitioners and researchers improve the quality of COVID-19 software through an empirical study of open source software projects related to COVID-19. Methodology: We use 129 open source COVID-19 software projects hosted on GitHub to conduct our empirical study. Next, we apply qualitative analysis on 550 bug reports from the collected projects to identify bug categories. Findings: We identify 8 bug categories, which include data bugs i.e., bugs that occur during mining and storage of COVID-19 data. The identified bug categories appear for 7 categories of software projects including (i) projects that use statistical modeling to perform predictions related to COVID-19, and (ii) medical equipment software that are used to design and implement medical equipment, such as ventilators. Conclusion: Based on our findings, we advocate for robust statistical model construction through better synergies between data science practitioners and public health experts. Existence of security bugs in user tracking software necessitates development of tools that will detect data privacy violations and security weaknesses.	Arxiv
108	COVID-Rate: An Automated Framework for Segmentation of COVID-19 Lesions   from Chest CT Scans. Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory infection that has had devastating effects on the world. Recently, new COVID-19 variants are emerging making the situation more challenging and threatening. Evaluation and quantification of COVID-19 lung abnormalities based on chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans can help determining the disease stage, efficiently allocating limited healthcare resources, and making informed treatment decisions. During pandemic era, however, visual assessment and quantification of COVID-19 lung lesions by expert radiologists become expensive and prone to error, which raises an urgent quest to develop practical autonomous solutions. In this context, first, the paper introduces an open access COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset containing 433 CT images from 82 patients that have been annotated by an expert radiologist. Second, a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based framework is proposed, referred to as the COVID-Rate, that autonomously segments lung abnormalities associated with COVID-19 from chest CT scans. Performance of the proposed COVID-Rate framework is evaluated through several experiments based on the introduced and external datasets. The results show a dice score of 0:802 and specificity and sensitivity of 0:997 and 0:832, respectively. Furthermore, the results indicate that the COVID-Rate model can efficiently segment COVID-19 lesions in both 2D CT images and whole lung volumes. Results on the external dataset illustrate generalization capabilities of the COVID-Rate model to CT images obtained from a different scanner.	Arxiv

110	Classification of COVID-19 Patients with their Severity Level from Chest   CT Scans using Transfer Learning. Background and Objective: During pandemics, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches combined with biomedical science play a significant role in reducing the burden on the healthcare systems and physicians. The rapid increment in cases of COVID-19 has led to an increase in demand for hospital beds and other medical equipment. However, since medical facilities are limited, it is recommended to diagnose patients as per the severity of the infection. Keeping this in mind, we share our research in detecting COVID-19 as well as assessing its severity using chest-CT scans and Deep Learning pre-trained models. Dataset: We have collected a total of 1966 CT Scan images for three different class labels, namely, Non-COVID, Severe COVID, and Non-Severe COVID, out of which 714 CT images belong to the Non-COVID category, 713 CT images are for Non-Severe COVID category and 539 CT images are of Severe COVID category. Methods: All of the images are initially pre-processed using the Contrast Limited Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) approach. The pre-processed images are then fed into the VGG-16 network for extracting features. Finally, the retrieved characteristics are categorized and the accuracy is evaluated using a support vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold cross-validation (CV). Result and Conclusion: In our study, we have combined well-known strategies for pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification which brings us to a remarkable success rate of disease and its severity recognition with an accuracy of 96.05% (97.7% for Non-Severe COVID-19 images and 93% for Severe COVID-19 images). Our model can therefore help radiologists detect COVID-19 and the extent of its severity.	Arxiv
111	COVID-19 Docking Server: A meta server for docking small molecules,   peptides and antibodies against potential targets of COVID-19. Motivation: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from China and led to thousands of death globally since December 2019. Despite many groups have engaged in studying the newly emerged virus and searching for the treatment of COVID-19, the understanding of the COVID-19 target-ligand interactions represents a key chal-lenge.

112	Detection of Covid-19 From Chest X-ray Images Using Artificial   Intelligence: An Early Review. In 2019, the entire world is facing a situation of health emergency due to a newly emerged coronavirus (COVID-19). Almost 196 countries are affected by covid-19, while USA, Italy, China, Spain, Iran, and France have the maximum active cases of COVID-19. The issues, medical and healthcare departments are facing in delay of detecting the COVID-19. Several artificial intelligence based system are designed for the automatic detection of COVID-19 using chest x-rays. In this article we will discuss the different approaches used for the detection of COVID-19 and the challenges we are facing. It is mandatory to develop an automatic detection system to prevent the transfer of the virus through contact. Several deep learning architecture are deployed for the detection of COVID-19 such as ResNet, Inception, Googlenet etc. All these approaches are detecting the subjects suffering with pneumonia while its hard to decide whether the pneumonia is caused by COVID-19 or due to any other bacterial or fungal attack.

113	MM-COVID: A Multilingual and Multimodal Data Repository for Combating   COVID-19 Disinformation. The COVID-19 epidemic is considered as the global health crisis of the whole society and the greatest challenge mankind faced since World War Two. Unfortunately, the fake news about COVID-19 is spreading as fast as the virus itself. The incorrect health measurements, anxiety, and hate speeches will have bad consequences on people's physical health, as well as their mental health in the whole world. To help better combat the COVID-19 fake news, we propose a new fake news detection dataset MM-COVID(Multilingual and Multidimensional COVID-19 Fake News Data Repository). This dataset provides the multilingual fake news and the relevant social context. We collect 3981 pieces of fake news content and 7192 trustworthy information from English, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi, French and Italian, 6 different languages. We present a detailed and exploratory analysis of MM-COVID from different perspectives and demonstrate the utility of MM-COVID in several potential applications of COVID-19 fake news study on multilingual and social media.

114	Exploiting Shared Knowledge from Non-COVID Lesions for   Annotation-Efficient COVID-19 CT Lung Infection Segmentation. The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus and has spread all over the world, posing an extremely serious threat to all countries. Automatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major challenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently, there are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing the potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19 segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven collaborative learning model to exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung infection segmentation. The model consists of a general encoder to capture general lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions, and a target encoder to focus on task-specific features based on COVID-19 infections. Features extracted from the two parallel encoders are concatenated for the subsequent decoder part. We develop a collaborative learning scheme to regularize feature-level relation consistency of given input and encourage the model to learn more general and discriminative representation of COVID-19 infections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that trained with limited COVID-19 data, exploiting shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions can further improve state-of-the-art performance with up to 3.0% in dice similarity coefficient and 4.2% in normalized surface dice. Our proposed method promotes new insights into annotation-efficient deep learning for COVID-19 infection segmentation and illustrates strong potential for real-world applications in the global fight against COVID-19 in the absence of sufficient high-quality annotations.

115	CML-COVID: A Large-Scale COVID-19 Twitter Dataset with Latent Topics,   Sentiment and Location Information. As a platform, Twitter has been a significant public space for discussion related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Public social media platforms such as Twitter represent important sites of engagement regarding the pandemic and these data can be used by research teams for social, health, and other research. Understanding public opinion about COVID-19 and how information diffuses in social media is important for governments and research institutions. Twitter is a ubiquitous public platform and, as such, has tremendous utility for understanding public perceptions, behavior, and attitudes related to COVID-19. In this research, we present CML-COVID, a COVID-19 Twitter data set of 19,298,967 million tweets from 5,977,653 unique individuals and summarize some of the attributes of these data. These tweets were collected between March 2020 and July 2020 using the query terms coronavirus, covid and mask related to COVID-19. We use topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and descriptive statistics to describe the tweets related to COVID-19 we collected and the geographical location of tweets, where available. We provide information on how to access our tweet dataset (archived using twarc).	Arxiv
116	Reliable COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-ray Images. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged the need for computer-aided diagnosis with automatic, accurate, and fast algorithms. Recent studies have applied Machine Learning algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis over chest X-ray (CXR) images. However, the data scarcity in these studies prevents a reliable evaluation with the potential of overfitting and limits the performance of deep networks. Moreover, these networks can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia usually from healthy subjects only or occasionally, from limited pneumonia types. Thus, there is a need for a robust and accurate COVID-19 detector evaluated over a large CXR dataset. To address this need, in this study, we propose a reliable COVID-19 detection network: ReCovNet, which can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia from 14 different thoracic diseases and healthy subjects. To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest COVID-19 CXR dataset: QaTa-COV19 with 124,616 images including 4603 COVID-19 samples. The proposed ReCovNet achieved a detection performance with 98.57% sensitivity and 99.77% specificity.	Arxiv
117	COVID-Net CT-S: 3D Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for   COVID-19 Severity Assessment using Chest CT Images. The health and socioeconomic difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause enormous tensions around the world. In particular, this extraordinary surge in the number of cases has put considerable strain on health care systems around the world. A critical step in the treatment and management of COVID-19 positive patients is severity assessment, which is challenging even for expert radiologists given the subtleties at different stages of lung disease severity. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce COVID-Net CT-S, a suite of deep convolutional neural networks for predicting lung disease severity due to COVID-19 infection. More specifically, a 3D residual architecture design is leveraged to learn volumetric visual indicators characterizing the degree of COVID-19 lung disease severity. Experimental results using the patient cohort collected by the China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB) showed that the proposed COVID-Net CT-S networks, by leveraging volumetric features, can achieve significantly improved severity assessment performance when compared to traditional severity assessment networks that learn and leverage 2D visual features to characterize COVID-19 severity.

118	Pandemic Pressures and Public Health Care: Evidence from England. This paper documents that the COVID-19 pandemic induced pressures on the health care system have significant adverse knock-on effects on the accessibility and quality of non-COVID-19 care. We observe persistently worsened performance and longer waiting times in A&E; drastically limited access to specialist care; notably delayed or inaccessible diagnostic services; acutely undermined access to and quality of cancer care. We find that providers under COVID-19 pressures experience notably more excess deaths among non-COVID related hospital episodes such as, for example, for treatment of heart attacks. We estimate there to be at least one such non-COVID-19 related excess death among patients being admitted to hospital for non-COVID-19 reasons for every 30 COVID-19 deaths that is caused by the disruption to the quality of care due to COVID-19. In total, this amounts to 4,003 non COVID-19 excess deaths from March 2020 to February 2021. Further, there are at least 32,189 missing cancer patients that should counterfactually have started receiving treatment which suggests continued increased numbers of excess deaths in the future due to delayed access to care in the past.

119	COVID-19 Hospitalizations Forecasts Using Internet Search Data. As the COVID-19 spread over the globe and new variants of COVID-19 keep occurring, reliable real-time forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations are critical for public health decision on medical resources allocations such as ICU beds, ventilators, and personnel to prepare for the surge of COVID-19 pandemics. Inspired by the strong association between public search behavior and hospitalization admission, we extended previously-proposed influenza tracking model, ARGO (AutoRegression with GOogle search data), to predict future 2-week national and state-level COVID-19 new hospital admissions. Leveraging the COVID-19 related time series information and Google search data, our method is able to robustly capture new COVID-19 variants' surges, and self-correct at both national and state level. Based on our retrospective out-of-sample evaluation over 12-month comparison period, our method achieves on average 15\% error reduction over the best alternative models collected from COVID-19 forecast hub. Overall, we showed that our method is flexible, self-correcting, robust, accurate, and interpretable, making it a potentially powerful tool to assist health-care officials and decision making for the current and future infectious disease outbreak.

120	"The effect of the rapid growth of covid-19 publications on citation   indicators. A concern has been raised that ""covidization"" of research would cause an overemphasizes on covid-19 and pandemics at the expense of other research. The rapid growth of publications related to the Covid-19 pandemic renders a vast amount of citations from this literature. This growth may affect bibliometric indicators. In this paper I explored how the growth of covid-19 publications influences bibliometric indicators commonly used in university rankings, research evaluation and research allocation, namely the field normalized citation score and the journal impact factor. I found that the burst of publications in the early stage of the covid-19 pandemic affects field-normalized citation scores and will affect the journal impact factor. Publications unrelated to covid-19 are also heavily affected. I conclude that there is a considerable risk to draw misleading conclusions from citation indicators spanning over the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, in particular when time series are used and when the biomedical literature is assessed."

121	Post-COVID-19 Effects on Female Fertility: An In-Depth Scientific   Investigation. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the post-COVID-19 effects on female fertility in patients with a history of severe COVID-19 infection. Data were collected from 340 patients who had previously experienced severe COVID-19 symptoms and sought medical assistance at private clinics and fertility centers in various provinces of Iraq. A comparative control group of 280 patients, who had not contracted COVID-19 or had mild cases, was included. The study assessed ovarian reserve, hormonal imbalances, and endometrial health in the post-recovery phase. The findings revealed a significant decrease in ovarian reserve, hormonal disturbances, and endometrial abnormalities among patients with a history of severe COVID-19 infection compared to the control group. This in-depth investigation sheds light on the potential long-term impacts of severe COVID-19 on female fertility. The results emphasize the need for further research and targeted interventions to support women affected by post-COVID-19 fertility issues. Understanding these effects is crucial for providing appropriate medical care and support to women on their reproductive journey after recovering from severe COVID-19.	Arxiv
122	Machine Learning Automatically Detects COVID-19 using Chest CTs in a   Large Multicenter Cohort. Objectives: To investigate machine-learning classifiers and interpretable models using chest CT for detection of COVID-19 and differentiation from other pneumonias, ILD and normal CTs.   Methods: Our retrospective multi-institutional study obtained 2096 chest CTs from 16 institutions (including 1077 COVID-19 patients). Training/testing cohorts included 927/100 COVID-19, 388/33 ILD, 189/33 other pneumonias, and 559/34 normal (no pathologies) CTs. A metric-based approach for classification of COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and random forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 via 3D features extracted directly from CT attenuation and probability distribution of airspace opacities.   Results: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are percentage of airspace opacity and peripheral and basal predominant opacities, concordant with the typical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering compares feature distribution across COVID-19 and control cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC=0.83, sensitivity=0.74, and specificity=0.79 of versus respectively 0.93, 0.90, and 0.83 for the DL-based classifier. Most of ambiguity comes from non-COVID-19 pneumonia with manifestations that overlap with COVID-19, as well as mild COVID-19 cases. Non-COVID-19 classification performance is 91% for ILD, 64% for other pneumonias and 94% for no pathologies, which demonstrates the robustness of our method against different compositions of control groups.   Conclusions: Our new method accurately discriminates COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia, ILD, and no pathologies CTs, using quantitative imaging features derived from chest CT, while balancing interpretability of results and classification performance, and therefore may be useful to facilitate diagnosis of COVID-19.

123	COVID-19 Cough Classification using Machine Learning and Global   Smartphone Recordings. We present a machine learning based COVID-19 cough classifier which can discriminate COVID-19 positive coughs from both COVID-19 negative and healthy coughs recorded on a smartphone. This type of screening is non-contact, easy to apply, and can reduce the workload in testing centres as well as limit transmission by recommending early self-isolation to those who have a cough suggestive of COVID-19. The datasets used in this study include subjects from all six continents and contain both forced and natural coughs, indicating that the approach is widely applicable. The publicly available Coswara dataset contains 92 COVID-19 positive and 1079 healthy subjects, while the second smaller dataset was collected mostly in South Africa and contains 18 COVID-19 positive and 26 COVID-19 negative subjects who have undergone a SARS-CoV laboratory test. Both datasets indicate that COVID-19 positive coughs are 15\%-20\% shorter than non-COVID coughs. Dataset skew was addressed by applying the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). A leave-$p$-out cross-validation scheme was used to train and evaluate seven machine learning classifiers: LR, KNN, SVM, MLP, CNN, LSTM and Resnet50. Our results show that although all classifiers were able to identify COVID-19 coughs, the best performance was exhibited by the Resnet50 classifier, which was best able to discriminate between the COVID-19 positive and the healthy coughs with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.98. An LSTM classifier was best able to discriminate between the COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative coughs, with an AUC of 0.94 after selecting the best 13 features from a sequential forward selection (SFS). Since this type of cough audio classification is cost-effective and easy to deploy, it is potentially a useful and viable means of non-contact COVID-19 screening.	Arxiv
124	A novel unsupervised covid lung lesion segmentation based on the lung   tissue identification. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of a novel unsupervised deep learning-based framework for automated infections lesion segmentation from CT images of Covid patients. In the first step, two residual networks were independently trained to identify the lung tissue for normal and Covid patients in a supervised manner. These two models, referred to as DL-Covid and DL-Norm for Covid-19 and normal patients, respectively, generate the voxel-wise probability maps for lung tissue identification. To detect Covid lesions, the CT image of the Covid patient is processed by the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models to obtain two lung probability maps. Since the DL-Norm model is not familiar with Covid infections within the lung, this model would assign lower probabilities to the lesions than the DL-Covid. Hence, the probability maps of the Covid infections could be generated through the subtraction of the two lung probability maps obtained from the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models. Manual lesion segmentation of 50 Covid-19 CT images was used to assess the accuracy of the unsupervised lesion segmentation approach. The Dice coefficients of 0.985 and 0.978 were achieved for the lung segmentation of normal and Covid patients in the external validation dataset, respectively. Quantitative results of infection segmentation by the proposed unsupervised method showed the Dice coefficient and Jaccard index of 0.67 and 0.60, respectively. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed unsupervised approach for Covid-19 infectious lesion segmentation showed relatively satisfactory results. Since this framework does not require any annotated dataset, it could be used to generate very large training samples for the supervised machine learning algorithms dedicated to noisy and/or weakly annotated datasets.

125	COVID-CT-Dataset: A CT Scan Dataset about COVID-19. During the outbreak time of COVID-19, computed tomography (CT) is a useful manner for diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Due to privacy issues, publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets are highly difficult to obtain, which hinders the research and development of AI-powered diagnosis methods of COVID-19 based on CTs. To address this issue, we build an open-sourced dataset -- COVID-CT, which contains 349 COVID-19 CT images from 216 patients and 463 non-COVID-19 CTs. The utility of this dataset is confirmed by a senior radiologist who has been diagnosing and treating COVID-19 patients since the outbreak of this pandemic. We also perform experimental studies which further demonstrate that this dataset is useful for developing AI-based diagnosis models of COVID-19. Using this dataset, we develop diagnosis methods based on multi-task learning and self-supervised learning, that achieve an F1 of 0.90, an AUC of 0.98, and an accuracy of 0.89. According to the senior radiologist, models with such performance are good enough for clinical usage. The data and code are available at https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT	Arxiv
126	Using A Partial Differential Equation with Google Mobility Data to   Predict COVID-19 in Arizona. The outbreak of COVID-19 disrupts the life of many people in the world. The state of Arizona in the U.S. emerges as one of the country's newest COVID-19 hot spots. Accurate forecasting for COVID-19 cases will help governments to implement necessary measures and convince more people to take personal precautions to combat the virus. It is difficult to accurately predict the COVID-19 cases due to many human factors involved. This paper aims to provide a forecasting model for COVID-19 cases with the help of human activity data from the Google Community Mobility Reports. To achieve this goal, a specific partial differential equation (PDE) is developed and validated with the COVID-19 data from the New York Times at the county level in the state of Arizona in the U.S. The proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among county clusters in Arizona and human actives on the transmission of COVID-19. The results show that the prediction accuracy of this model is well acceptable (above 94\%). Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of personal precautions such as wearing face masks and practicing social distancing on COVID-19 cases at the local level. The localized analytical results can be used to help to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Arizona. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to apply PDE models on COVID-19 prediction with the Google Community Mobility Reports.	Arxiv
127	COVID-19 vs Social Media Apps: Does Privacy Really Matter?. Many people around the world are worried about using or even downloading COVID-19 contact tracing mobile apps. The main reported concerns are centered around privacy and ethical issues. At the same time, people are voluntarily using Social Media apps at a significantly higher rate during the pandemic without similar privacy concerns compared with COVID-19 apps. To better understand these seemingly anomalous behaviours, we analysed the privacy policies, terms & conditions and data use agreements of the most commonly used COVID-19, Social Media & Productivity apps. We also developed a tool to extract and analyse nearly 2 million user reviews for these apps. Our results show that Social Media & Productivity apps actually have substantially higher privacy and ethical issues compared with the majority of COVID-19 apps. Surprisingly, lots of people indicated in their user reviews that they feel more secure as their privacy are better handled in COVID-19 apps than in Social Media apps. On the other hand, most of the COVID-19 apps are less accessible and stable compared to most Social Media apps, which negatively impacted their store ratings and led users to uninstall COVID-19 apps more frequently. Our findings suggest that in order to effectively fight this pandemic, health officials and technologists will need to better raise awareness among people about COVID-19 app behaviour and trustworthiness. This will allow people to better understand COVID-19 apps and encourage them to download and use these apps. Moreover, COVID-19 apps need many accessibility enhancements to allow a wider range of users from different societies and cultures to access to these apps.	Arxiv
128	COVID-view: Diagnosis of COVID-19 using Chest CT. Significant work has been done towards deep learning (DL) models for automatic lung and lesion segmentation and classification of COVID-19 on chest CT data. However, comprehensive visualization systems focused on supporting the dual visual+DL diagnosis of COVID-19 are non-existent. We present COVID-view, a visualization application specially tailored for radiologists to diagnose COVID-19 from chest CT data. The system incorporates a complete pipeline of automatic lungs segmentation, localization/ isolation of lung abnormalities, followed by visualization, visual and DL analysis, and measurement/quantification tools. Our system combines the traditional 2D workflow of radiologists with newer 2D and 3D visualization techniques with DL support for a more comprehensive diagnosis. COVID-view incorporates a novel DL model for classifying the patients into positive/negative COVID-19 cases, which acts as a reading aid for the radiologist using COVID-view and provides the attention heatmap as an explainable DL for the model output. We designed and evaluated COVID-view through suggestions, close feedback and conducting case studies of real-world patient data by expert radiologists who have substantial experience diagnosing chest CT scans for COVID-19, pulmonary embolism, and other forms of lung infections. We present requirements and task analysis for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that motivate our design choices and results in a practical system which is capable of handling real-world patient cases.	Arxiv
129	Collaboration in the Time of COVID: A Scientometric Analysis of   Multidisciplinary SARS-CoV-2 Research. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 illness it causes have inspired unprecedented levels of multidisciplinary research in an effort to address a generational public health challenge. In this work we conduct a scientometric analysis of COVID-19 research, paying particular attention to the nature of collaboration that this pandemic has fostered among different disciplines. Increased multidisciplinary collaboration has been shown to produce greater scientific impact, albeit with higher co-ordination costs. As such, we consider a collection of over 166,000 COVID-19-related articles to assess the scale and diversity of collaboration in COVID-19 research, which we compare to non-COVID-19 controls before and during the pandemic. We show that COVID-19 research teams are not only significantly smaller than their non-COVID-19 counterparts, but they are also more diverse. Furthermore, we find that COVID-19 research has increased the multidisciplinarity of authors across most scientific fields of study, indicating that COVID-19 has helped to remove some of the barriers that usually exist between disparate disciplines. Finally, we highlight a number of interesting areas of multidisciplinary research during COVID-19, and propose methodologies for visualising the nature of multidisciplinary collaboration, which may have application beyond this pandemic.

130	Deep Learning Prediction of Severe Health Risks for Pediatric COVID-19   Patients with a Large Feature Set in 2021 BARDA Data Challenge. Most children infected with COVID-19 have no or mild symptoms and can recover automatically by themselves, but some pediatric COVID-19 patients need to be hospitalized or even to receive intensive medical care (e.g., invasive mechanical ventilation or cardiovascular support) to recover from the illnesses. Therefore, it is critical to predict the severe health risk that COVID-19 infection poses to children to provide precise and timely medical care for vulnerable pediatric COVID-19 patients. However, predicting the severe health risk for COVID-19 patients including children remains a significant challenge because many underlying medical factors affecting the risk are still largely unknown. In this work, instead of searching for a small number of most useful features to make prediction, we design a novel large-scale bag-of-words like method to represent various medical conditions and measurements of COVID-19 patients. After some simple feature filtering based on logistical regression, the large set of features is used with a deep learning method to predict both the hospitalization risk for COVID-19 infected children and the severe complication risk for the hospitalized pediatric COVID-19 patients. The method was trained and tested the datasets of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) Pediatric COVID-19 Data Challenge held from Sept. 15 to Dec. 17, 2021. The results show that the approach can rather accurately predict the risk of hospitalization and severe complication for pediatric COVID-19 patients and deep learning is more accurate than other machine learning methods.

131	COVID-Net Assistant: A Deep Learning-Driven Virtual Assistant for   COVID-19 Symptom Prediction and Recommendation. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to put a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide, there has been growing interest in finding inexpensive symptom pre-screening and recommendation methods to assist in efficiently using available medical resources such as PCR tests. In this study, we introduce the design of COVID-Net Assistant, an efficient virtual assistant designed to provide symptom prediction and recommendations for COVID-19 by analyzing users' cough recordings through deep convolutional neural networks. We explore a variety of highly customized, lightweight convolutional neural network architectures generated via machine-driven design exploration (which we refer to as COVID-Net Assistant neural networks) on the Covid19-Cough benchmark dataset. The Covid19-Cough dataset comprises 682 cough recordings from a COVID-19 positive cohort and 642 from a COVID-19 negative cohort. Among the 682 cough recordings labeled positive, 382 recordings were verified by PCR test. Our experimental results show promising, with the COVID-Net Assistant neural networks demonstrating robust predictive performance, achieving AUC scores of over 0.93, with the best score over 0.95 while being fast and efficient in inference. The COVID-Net Assistant models are made available in an open source manner through the COVID-Net open initiative and, while not a production-ready solution, we hope their availability acts as a good resource for clinical scientists, machine learning researchers, as well as citizen scientists to develop innovative solutions.

132	Boosting Automatic COVID-19 Detection Performance with Self-Supervised   Learning and Batch Knowledge Ensembling. Problem: Detecting COVID-19 from chest X-Ray (CXR) images has become one of the fastest and easiest methods for detecting COVID-19. However, the existing methods usually use supervised transfer learning from natural images as a pretraining process. These methods do not consider the unique features of COVID-19 and the similar features between COVID-19 and other pneumonia. Aim: In this paper, we want to design a novel high-accuracy COVID-19 detection method that uses CXR images, which can consider the unique features of COVID-19 and the similar features between COVID-19 and other pneumonia. Methods: Our method consists of two phases. One is self-supervised learning-based pertaining; the other is batch knowledge ensembling-based fine-tuning. Self-supervised learning-based pretraining can learn distinguished representations from CXR images without manually annotated labels. On the other hand, batch knowledge ensembling-based fine-tuning can utilize category knowledge of images in a batch according to their visual feature similarities to improve detection performance. Unlike our previous implementation, we introduce batch knowledge ensembling into the fine-tuning phase, reducing the memory used in self-supervised learning and improving COVID-19 detection accuracy. Results: On two public COVID-19 CXR datasets, namely, a large dataset and an unbalanced dataset, our method exhibited promising COVID-19 detection performance. Our method maintains high detection accuracy even when annotated CXR training images are reduced significantly (e.g., using only 10% of the original dataset). In addition, our method is insensitive to changes in hyperparameters.	Arxiv
133	Residual Attention U-Net for Automated Multi-Class Segmentation of   COVID-19 Chest CT Images. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly around the world and caused significant impact on the public health and economy. However, there is still lack of studies on effectively quantifying the lung infection caused by COVID-19. As a basic but challenging task of the diagnostic framework, segmentation plays a crucial role in accurate quantification of COVID-19 infection measured by computed tomography (CT) images. To this end, we proposed a novel deep learning algorithm for automated segmentation of multiple COVID-19 infection regions. Specifically, we use the Aggregated Residual Transformations to learn a robust and expressive feature representation and apply the soft attention mechanism to improve the capability of the model to distinguish a variety of symptoms of the COVID-19. With a public CT image dataset, we validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in comparison with other competing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our algorithm for automated segmentation of COVID-19 Chest CT images. Our study provides a promising deep leaning-based segmentation tool to lay a foundation to quantitative diagnosis of COVID-19 lung infection in CT images.	Arxiv
134	MiniSeg: An Extremely Minimum Network for Efficient COVID-19   Segmentation. The rapid spread of the new pandemic, i.e., COVID-19, has severely threatened global health. Deep-learning-based computer-aided screening, e.g., COVID-19 infected CT area segmentation, has attracted much attention. However, the publicly available COVID-19 training data are limited, easily causing overfitting for traditional deep learning methods that are usually data-hungry with millions of parameters. On the other hand, fast training/testing and low computational cost are also necessary for quick deployment and development of COVID-19 screening systems, but traditional deep learning methods are usually computationally intensive. To address the above problems, we propose MiniSeg, a lightweight deep learning model for efficient COVID-19 segmentation. Compared with traditional segmentation methods, MiniSeg has several significant strengths: i) it only has 83K parameters and is thus not easy to overfit; ii) it has high computational efficiency and is thus convenient for practical deployment; iii) it can be fast retrained by other users using their private COVID-19 data for further improving performance. In addition, we build a comprehensive COVID-19 segmentation benchmark for comparing MiniSeg to traditional methods.	Arxiv

To help researchers combat COVID-19 health misinformation, therefore, we present CoAID (Covid-19 heAlthcare mIsinformation Dataset), with diverse COVID-19 healthcare misinformation, including fake news on websites and social platforms, along with users' social engagement about such news. CoAID includes 4,251 news, 296,000 related user engagements, 926 social platform posts about COVID-19, and ground truth labels. The dataset is available at: https://github.com/cuilimeng/CoAID.	Arxiv
137	Tracking the Twitter attention around the research efforts on the   COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a bulk of scientific research and related Twitter discussions. To unravel the public concerns about the COVID-19 crisis reflected in the science-based Twitter conversations, this study tracked the Twitter attention around the COVID-19 research efforts during the first three months of 2020. On the basis of nearly 1.4 million Twitter mentions of 6,162 COVID-19-related scientific publications, we investigated the temporal tweeting dynamic and the Twitter users involved in the online discussions around COVID-19-related research. The results show that the quantity of Twitter mentions of COVID-19-related publications was on rising. Scholarly-oriented Twitter users played an influential role in disseminating research outputs on COVID-19, with their tweets being frequently retweeted. Over time, a change in the focus of the Twitter discussions can be observed, from the initial attention to virological and clinical research to more practical topics, such as the potential treatments, the countermeasures by the governments, the healthcare measures, and the influences on the economy and society, in more recent times.

Recently there has been a formidable work which has been put up from the people who are working in the frontlines such as hospitals, clinics, and labs alongside researchers and scientists who are also putting tremendous efforts in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the preposterous spread of the virus, the integration of the artificial intelligence has taken a considerable part in the health sector, by implementing the fundamentals of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we illustrate the importance of speech signal processing in the extraction of the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) of the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 samples and find their relationship using Pearson correlation coefficients. Our results show high similarity in MFCCs between different COVID-19 cough and breathing sounds, while MFCC of voice is more robust between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 samples. Moreover, our results are preliminary, and there is a possibility to exclude the voices of COVID-19 patients from further processing in diagnosing the disease.	Arxiv
139	FLANNEL: Focal Loss Based Neural Network Ensemble for COVID-19 Detection. To test the possibility of differentiating chest x-ray images of COVID-19 against other pneumonia and healthy patients using deep neural networks. We construct the X-ray imaging data from two publicly available sources, which include 5508 chest x-ray images across 2874 patients with four classes: normal, bacterial pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, and COVID-19. To identify COVID-19, we propose a Focal Loss Based Neural Ensemble Network (FLANNEL), a flexible module to ensemble several convolutional neural network (CNN) models and fuse with a focal loss for accurate COVID-19 detection on class imbalance data. FLANNEL consistently outperforms baseline models on COVID-19 identification task in all metrics. Compared with the best baseline, FLANNEL shows a higher macro-F1 score with 6% relative increase on Covid-19 identification task where it achieves 0.7833(0.07) in Precision, 0.8609(0.03) in Recall, and 0.8168(0.03) F1 score.

140	Change point detection for COVID-19 excess deaths in Belgium. Emerging at the end of 2019, COVID-19 has become a public health threat to people worldwide. Apart from the deaths who tested positive for COVID-19, many others have died from causes indirectly related to COVID-19. Therefore, the COVID-19 confirmed deaths underestimate the influence of the pandemic on the society; instead, the measure of `excess deaths' is a more objective and comparable way to assess the scale of the epidemic and formulate lessons. One common practical issue in analyzing the impact of COVID-19 is to determine the `pre-COVID-19' period and the `post-COVID-19' period. We apply a change point detection method to identify any change points using the excess deaths in Belgium.	Arxiv
141	The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Scientific Research in the Life   Sciences. The COVID-19 outbreak has posed an unprecedented challenge to humanity and science. On the one side, public and private incentives have been put in place to promptly allocate resources toward research areas strictly related to the COVID-19 emergency. But on the flip side, research in many fields not directly related to the pandemic has lagged behind. In this paper, we assess the impact of COVID-19 on world scientific production in the life sciences. We investigate how the usage of medical subject headings (MeSH) has changed following the outbreak. We estimate through a difference-in-differences approach the impact of COVID-19 on scientific production through PubMed. We find that COVID-related research topics have risen to prominence, displaced clinical publications, diverted funds away from research areas not directly related to COVID-19 and that the number of publications on clinical trials in unrelated fields has contracted. Our results call for urgent targeted policy interventions to reactivate biomedical research in areas that have been neglected by the COVID-19 emergency.	Arxiv
142	Modeling Macroeconomic Variations After COVID-19. The coronavirus is a global event of historical proportions and just a few months changed the time series properties of the data in ways that make many pre-covid forecasting models inadequate. It also creates a new problem for estimation of economic factors and dynamic causal effects because the variations around the outbreak can be interpreted as outliers, as shifts to the distribution of existing shocks, or as addition of new shocks. I take the latter view and use covid indicators as controls to 'de-covid' the data prior to estimation. I find that economic uncertainty remains high at the end of 2020 even though real economic activity has recovered and covid uncertainty has receded. Dynamic responses of variables to shocks in a VAR similar in magnitude and shape to the ones identified before 2020 can be recovered by directly or indirectly modeling covid and treating it as exogenous. These responses to economic shocks are distinctly different from those to a covid shock which are much larger but shorter lived. Disentangling the two types of shocks can be important in macroeconomic modeling post-covid.	Arxiv
143	Evaluating the COVID-19 Identification ResNet (CIdeR) on the INTERSPEECH   COVID-19 from Audio Challenges. We report on cross-running the recent COVID-19 Identification ResNet (CIdeR) on the two Interspeech 2021 COVID-19 diagnosis from cough and speech audio challenges: ComParE and DiCOVA. CIdeR is an end-to-end deep learning neural network originally designed to classify whether an individual is COVID-positive or COVID-negative based on coughing and breathing audio recordings from a published crowdsourced dataset. In the current study, we demonstrate the potential of CIdeR at binary COVID-19 diagnosis from both the COVID-19 Cough and Speech Sub-Challenges of INTERSPEECH 2021, ComParE and DiCOVA. CIdeR achieves significant improvements over several baselines.	Arxiv
144	Predicting the spread of COVID-19 in Delhi, India using Deep Residual   Recurrent Neural Networks. Detecting the spread of coronavirus will go a long way toward reducing human and economic loss. Unfortunately, existing Epidemiological models used for COVID 19 prediction models are too slow and fail to capture the COVID-19 development in detail. This research uses Partial Differential Equations to improve the processing speed and accuracy of forecasting of COVID 19 governed by SEIRD model equations. The dynamics of COVID 19 were extracted using Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Residual Recurrent Neural Networks from data simulated using PDEs. The DRRNNs accuracy is measured using Mean Squared Error. The DRRNNs COVID-19 prediction model has been shown to have accurate COVID-19 predictions. In addition, we concluded that DR-RNNs can significantly advance the ability to support decision-making in real time COVID-19 prediction.	Arxiv
145	On the intrinsic dimensionality of Covid-19 data: a global perspective. This paper aims to develop a global perspective of the complexity of the relationship between the standardised per-capita growth rate of Covid-19 cases, deaths, and the OxCGRT Covid-19 Stringency Index, a measure describing a country's stringency of lockdown policies. To achieve our goal, we use a heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimator implemented as a Bayesian mixture model, called Hidalgo. We identify that the Covid-19 dataset may project onto two low-dimensional manifolds without significant information loss. The low dimensionality suggests strong dependency among the standardised growth rates of cases and deaths per capita and the OxCGRT Covid-19 Stringency Index for a country over 2020-2021. Given the low dimensional structure, it may be feasible to model observable Covid-19 dynamics with few parameters. Importantly, we identify spatial autocorrelation in the intrinsic dimension distribution worldwide. Moreover, we highlight that high-income countries are more likely to lie on low-dimensional manifolds, likely arising from aging populations, comorbidities, and increased per capita mortality burden from Covid-19. Finally, we temporally stratify the dataset to examine the intrinsic dimension at a more granular level throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.	Arxiv
146	Impact of COVID-19 on Astronomy: Two Years In. We study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on astronomy using public records of astronomical publications. We show that COVID-19 has had both positive and negative impacts on research in astronomy. We find that the overall output of the field, measured by the yearly paper count, has increased. This is mainly driven by boosted individual productivity seen across most countries, possibly the result of cultural and technological changes in the scientific community during COVID. However, a decreasing number of incoming new researchers is seen in most of the countries we studied, indicating larger barriers for new researchers to enter the field or for junior researchers to complete their first project during COVID. Unfortunately, the overall improvement in productivity seen in the field is not equally shared by female astronomers. By fraction, fewer papers are written by women and fewer women are among incoming new researchers in most countries. Even though female astronomers also became more productive during COVID, the level of improvement is smaller than for men. Pre-COVID, female astronomers in the Netherlands, Australia, Switzerland were equally as or even more productive than their male colleagues. During COVID, no single country's female astronomers were able to be more productive than their male colleagues on average.	Arxiv
147	COVID-19 Disease Identification on Chest-CT images using CNN and VGG16. A newly identified coronavirus disease called COVID-19 mainly affects the human respiratory system. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a virus originating in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Early diagnosis is the primary challenge of health care providers. In the earlier stage, medical organizations were dazzled because there were no proper health aids or medicine to detect a COVID-19. A new diagnostic tool RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction), was introduced. It collects swab specimens from the patient's nose or throat, where the COVID-19 virus gathers. This method has some limitations related to accuracy and testing time. Medical experts suggest an alternative approach called CT (Computed Tomography) that can quickly diagnose the infected lung areas and identify the COVID-19 in an earlier stage. Using chest CT images, computer researchers developed several deep learning models identifying the COVID-19 disease. This study presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and VGG16-based model for automated COVID-19 identification on chest CT images. The experimental results using a public dataset of 14320 CT images showed a classification accuracy of 96.34% and 96.99% for CNN and VGG16, respectively.	Arxiv
148	A review of Deep learning Techniques for COVID-19 identification on   Chest CT images. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a serious threat to humanity that directly affects the lungs. Automatic identification of COVID-19 is a challenge for health care officials. The standard gold method for diagnosing COVID-19 is Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) to collect swabs from affected people. Some limitations encountered while collecting swabs are related to accuracy and longtime duration. Chest CT (Computed Tomography) is another test method that helps healthcare providers quickly identify the infected lung areas. It was used as a supporting tool for identifying COVID-19 in an earlier stage. With the help of deep learning, the CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19. Researchers have proven it to be highly effective for COVID-19 CT image classification. In this study, we review the recent deep learning techniques that can use to detect the COVID-19 disease. Relevant studies were collected by various databases such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed. Finally, we compare the results of different deep learning models, and CT image analysis is discussed.	Arxiv

Increasing number of COVID-19 research literatures cause new challenges in effective literature screening and COVID-19 domain knowledge aware Information Retrieval. To tackle the challenges, we demonstrate two tasks along withsolutions, COVID-19 literature retrieval, and question answering. COVID-19 literature retrieval task screens matching COVID-19 literature documents for textual user query, and COVID-19 question answering task predicts proper text fragments from text corpus as the answer of specific COVID-19 related questions. Based on transformer neural network, we provided solutions to implement the tasks on CORD-19 dataset, we display some examples to show the effectiveness of our proposed solutions.	Arxiv
150	Vital Measurements of Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients as a Predictor of   Long COVID: An EHR-based Cohort Study from the RECOVER Program in N3C. It is shown that various symptoms could remain in the stage of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), otherwise known as Long COVID. A number of COVID patients suffer from heterogeneous symptoms, which severely impact recovery from the pandemic. While scientists are trying to give an unambiguous definition of Long COVID, efforts in prediction of Long COVID could play an important role in understanding the characteristic of this new disease. Vital measurements (e.g. oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure) could reflect body's most basic functions and are measured regularly during hospitalization, so among patients diagnosed COVID positive and hospitalized, we analyze the vital measurements of first 7 days since the hospitalization start date to study the pattern of the vital measurements and predict Long COVID with the information from vital measurements.

151	Understanding Complex Patterns in Social, Geographic, and Economic   Inequities in COVID-19 Mortality at the County Level in the US Using   Generalized Additive Models. I present three types of applications of generalized additive models (GAMs) to COVID-19 mortality rates in the US for the purpose of advancing methods to document inequities with respect to which communities suffered disproportionate COVID-19 mortality rates at specific times during the first three years of the pandemic. First, GAMs can be used to describe the changing relationship between COVID-19 mortality and county-level covariates (sociodemographic, economic, and political metrics) over time. Second, GAMs can be used to perform spatiotemporal smoothing that pools information over time and space to address statistical instability due to small population counts or stochasticity resulting in a smooth, dynamic latent risk surface summarizing the mortality risk associated with geographic locations over time. Third, estimation of COVID-19 mortality associations with county-level covariates conditional on a smooth spatiotemporal risk surface allows for more rigorous consideration of how socio-environmental contexts and policies may have impacted COVID-19 mortality. Each of these approaches provides a valuable perspective to documenting inequities in COVID-19 mortality by addressing the question of which populations have suffered the worst burden of COVID-19 mortality taking into account the nonlinear spatial, temporal, and social patterning of disease.

152	Not cool, calm or collected: Using emotional language to detect COVID-19   misinformation. COVID-19 misinformation on social media platforms such as twitter is a threat to effective pandemic management. Prior works on tweet COVID-19 misinformation negates the role of semantic features common to twitter such as charged emotions. Thus, we present a novel COVID-19 misinformation model, which uses both a tweet emotion encoder and COVID-19 misinformation encoder to predict whether a tweet contains COVID-19 misinformation. Our emotion encoder was fine-tuned on a novel annotated dataset and our COVID-19 misinformation encoder was fine-tuned on a subset of the COVID-HeRA dataset. Experimental results show superior results using the combination of emotion and misinformation encoders as opposed to a misinformation classifier alone. Furthermore, extensive result analysis was conducted, highlighting low quality labels and mismatched label distributions as key limitations to our study.	Arxiv
153	Predicting Outcomes in Long COVID Patients with Spatiotemporal Attention. Long COVID is a general term of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Patients with long COVID can endure long-lasting symptoms including fatigue, headache, dyspnea and anosmia, etc. Identifying the cohorts with severe long-term complications in COVID-19 could benefit the treatment planning and resource arrangement. However, due to the heterogeneous phenotype presented in long COVID patients, it is difficult to predict their outcomes from their longitudinal data. In this study, we proposed a spatiotemporal attention mechanism to weigh feature importance jointly from the temporal dimension and feature space. Considering that medical examinations can have interchangeable orders in adjacent time points, we restricted the learning of short-term dependency with a Local-LSTM and the learning of long-term dependency with the joint spatiotemporal attention. We also compared the proposed method with several state-of-the-art methods and a method in clinical practice. The methods are evaluated on a hard-to-acquire clinical dataset of patients with long COVID. Experimental results show the Local-LSTM with joint spatiotemporal attention outperformed related methods in outcome prediction. The proposed method provides a clinical tool for the severity assessment of long COVID.	Arxiv
154	A Big Data Based Framework for Executing Complex Query Over COVID-19   Datasets (COVID-QF). COVID-19's rapid global spread has driven innovative tools for Big Data Analytics. These have guided organizations in all fields of the health industry to track and minimized the effects of virus. Researchers are required to detect coronaviruses through artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing, and to gain a complete understanding of the disease. COVID-19 takes place in different countries in the world, with which only big data application and the work of NOSQL databases are suitable. There is a great number of platforms used for processing NOSQL Databases model like: Spark, H2O and Hadoop HDFS/MapReduce, which are proper to control and manage the enormous amount of data. Many challenges faced by large applications programmers, especially those that work on the COVID-19 databases through hybrid data models through different APIs and query. In this context, this paper proposes a storage framework to handle both SQL and NOSQL databases named (COVID-QF) for COVID-19 datasets in order to treat and handle the problems caused by virus spreading worldwide by reducing treatment times. In case of NoSQL database, COVID-QF uses Hadoop HDFS/Map Reduce and Apache Spark. The COVID-QF consists of three Layers: data collection layer, storage layer, and query Processing layer. The data is collected in the data collection layer. The storage layer divides data into collection of data-saving and processing blocks, and it connects the Connector of the spark with different databases engine to reduce time of saving and retrieving. While the Processing layer executes the request query and sends results. The proposed framework used three datasets increased for time for COVID-19 data (COVID-19-Merging, COVID-19-inside-Hubei and COVID-19-ex-Hubei) to test experiments of this study. The results obtained insure the superiority of the COVID-QF framework.	Arxiv
155	COVID-19 SignSym: a fast adaptation of a general clinical NLP tool to   identify and normalize COVID-19 signs and symptoms to OMOP common data model. The COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world rapidly, infecting millions of people. An efficient tool that can accurately recognize important clinical concepts of COVID-19 from free text in electronic health records (EHRs) will be valuable to accelerate COVID-19 clinical research. To this end, this study aims at adapting the existing CLAMP natural language processing tool to quickly build COVID-19 SignSym, which can extract COVID-19 signs/symptoms and their 8 attributes (body location, severity, temporal expression, subject, condition, uncertainty, negation, and course) from clinical text. The extracted information is also mapped to standard concepts in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model. A hybrid approach of combining deep learning-based models, curated lexicons, and pattern-based rules was applied to quickly build the COVID-19 SignSym from CLAMP, with optimized performance. Our extensive evaluation using 3 external sites with clinical notes of COVID-19 patients, as well as the online medical dialogues of COVID-19, shows COVID-19 Sign-Sym can achieve high performance across data sources. The workflow used for this study can be generalized to other use cases, where existing clinical natural language processing tools need to be customized for specific information needs within a short time. COVID-19 SignSym is freely accessible to the research community as a downloadable package (https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/nlp.php) and has been used by 16 healthcare organizations to support clinical research of COVID-19.

156	COVID-Net CT-2: Enhanced Deep Neural Networks for Detection of COVID-19   from Chest CT Images Through Bigger, More Diverse Learning. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage on, with multiple waves causing substantial harm to health and economies around the world. Motivated by the use of CT imaging at clinical institutes around the world as an effective complementary screening method to RT-PCR testing, we introduced COVID-Net CT, a neural network tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images as part of the open source COVID-Net initiative. However, one potential limiting factor is restricted quantity and diversity given the single nation patient cohort used. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net CT-2, enhanced deep neural networks for COVID-19 detection from chest CT images trained on the largest quantity and diversity of multinational patient cases in research literature. We introduce two new CT benchmark datasets, the largest comprising a multinational cohort of 4,501 patients from at least 15 countries. We leverage explainability to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVID-Net CT-2, with the results for select cases reviewed and reported on by two board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 30 years of experience, respectively. The COVID-Net CT-2 neural networks achieved accuracy, COVID-19 sensitivity, PPV, specificity, and NPV of 98.1%/96.2%/96.7%/99%/98.8% and 97.9%/95.7%/96.4%/98.9%/98.7%, respectively. Explainability-driven performance validation shows that COVID-Net CT-2's decision-making behaviour is consistent with radiologist interpretation by leveraging correct, clinically relevant critical factors. The results are promising and suggest the strong potential of deep neural networks as an effective tool for computer-aided COVID-19 assessment. While not a production-ready solution, we hope the open-source, open-access release of COVID-Net CT-2 and benchmark datasets will continue to enable researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to build upon them.

161	Finding Covid-19 from Chest X-rays using Deep Learning on a Small   Dataset. Testing for COVID-19 has been unable to keep up with the demand. Further, the false negative rate is projected to be as high as 30% and test results can take some time to obtain. X-ray machines are widely available and provide images for diagnosis quickly. This paper explores how useful chest X-ray images can be in diagnosing COVID-19 disease. We have obtained 122 chest X-rays of COVID-19 and over 4,000 chest X-rays of viral and bacterial pneumonia. A pretrained deep convolutional neural network has been tuned on 102 COVID-19 cases and 102 other pneumonia cases in a 10-fold cross validation. The results were all 102 COVID-19 cases were correctly classified and there were 8 false positives resulting in an AUC of 0.997. On a test set of 20 unseen COVID-19 cases all were correctly classified and more than 95% of 4171 other pneumonia examples were correctly classified. This study has flaws, most critically a lack of information about where in the disease process the COVID-19 cases were and the small data set size. More COVID-19 case images will enable a better answer to the question of how useful chest X-rays can be for diagnosing COVID-19 (so please send them).	Arxiv
162	CovidAID: COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-Ray. The exponential increase in COVID-19 patients is overwhelming healthcare systems across the world. With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every patient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques (RT-PCR). The tests also have long turn-around time, and limited sensitivity. Detecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high risk patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already available in most healthcare systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems already digitized, there is no transportation time involved for the samples either. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the selection of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an inpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to keep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in COVID-19 areas. It would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood of COVID with a false negative RT-PCR who would need repeat testing. Further, we propose the use of modern AI techniques to detect the COVID-19 patients using X-Ray images in an automated manner, particularly in settings where radiologists are not available, and help make the proposed testing technology scalable. We present CovidAID: COVID-19 AI Detector, a novel deep neural network based model to triage patients for appropriate testing. On the publicly available covid-chestxray-dataset [2], our model gives 90.5% accuracy with 100% sensitivity (recall) for the COVID-19 infection. We significantly improve upon the results of Covid-Net [10] on the same dataset.	Arxiv
163	Adaptive Feature Selection Guided Deep Forest for COVID-19   Classification with Chest CT. Chest computed tomography (CT) becomes an effective tool to assist the diagnosis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide, using the computed-aided diagnosis technique for COVID-19 classification based on CT images could largely alleviate the burden of clinicians. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Selection guided Deep Forest (AFS-DF) for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT images. Specifically, we first extract location-specific features from CT images. Then, in order to capture the high-level representation of these features with the relatively small-scale data, we leverage a deep forest model to learn high-level representation of the features. Moreover, we propose a feature selection method based on the trained deep forest model to reduce the redundancy of features, where the feature selection could be adaptively incorporated with the COVID-19 classification model. We evaluated our proposed AFS-DF on COVID-19 dataset with 1495 patients of COVID-19 and 1027 patients of community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and AUC achieved by our method are 91.79%, 93.05%, 89.95% and 96.35%, respectively. Experimental results on the COVID-19 dataset suggest that the proposed AFS-DF achieves superior performance in COVID-19 vs. CAP classification, compared with 4 widely used machine learning methods.

164	Automatic classification between COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19   pneumonia, and the healthy on chest X-ray image: combination of data   augmentation methods. Purpose: This study aimed to develop and validate computer-aided diagnosis (CXDx) system for classification between COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy on chest X-ray (CXR) images.   Materials and Methods: From two public datasets, 1248 CXR images were obtained, which included 215, 533, and 500 CXR images of COVID-19 pneumonia patients, non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients, and the healthy samples. The proposed CADx system utilized VGG16 as a pre-trained model and combination of conventional method and mixup as data augmentation methods. Other types of pre-trained models were compared with the VGG16-based model. Single type or no data augmentation methods were also evaluated. Splitting of training/validation/test sets was used when building and evaluating the CADx system. Three-category accuracy was evaluated for test set with 125 CXR images.   Results: The three-category accuracy of the CAD system was 83.6% between COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy. Sensitivity for COVID-19 pneumonia was more than 90%. The combination of conventional method and mixup was more useful than single type or no data augmentation method.   Conclusion: This study was able to create an accurate CADx system for the 3-category classification. Source code of our CADx system is available as open source for COVID-19 research.	Arxiv
165	Classification Aware Neural Topic Model and its Application on a New   COVID-19 Disinformation Corpus. The explosion of disinformation accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic has overloaded fact-checkers and media worldwide, and brought a new major challenge to government responses worldwide. Not only is disinformation creating confusion about medical science amongst citizens, but it is also amplifying distrust in policy makers and governments. To help tackle this, we developed computational methods to categorise COVID-19 disinformation. The COVID-19 disinformation categories could be used for a) focusing fact-checking efforts on the most damaging kinds of COVID-19 disinformation; b) guiding policy makers who are trying to deliver effective public health messages and counter effectively COVID-19 disinformation. This paper presents: 1) a corpus containing what is currently the largest available set of manually annotated COVID-19 disinformation categories; 2) a classification-aware neural topic model (CANTM) designed for COVID-19 disinformation category classification and topic discovery; 3) an extensive analysis of COVID-19 disinformation categories with respect to time, volume, false type, media type and origin source.

166	COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak in the Subcontinent: A data-driven analysis. Human civilization is experiencing a critical situation that presents itself for a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei, China. The grim fact of COVID-19 is, it is highly contagious in nature, therefore, spreads rapidly all over the world and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Responding to the severity of COVID-19 research community directs the attention to the analysis of COVID-19, to diminish its antagonistic impact towards society. Numerous studies claim that the subcontinent, i.e., Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, could remain in the worst affected region by the COVID-19. In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is important to predict the trend of COVID-19 beforehand the planning of effective control strategies. Fundamentally, the idea is to dependably estimate the reproduction number to judge the spread rate of COVID-19 in a particular region. Consequently, this paper uses publicly available epidemiological data of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan to estimate the reproduction numbers. More specifically, we use various models (for example, susceptible infection recovery (SIR), exponential growth (EG), sequential Bayesian (SB), maximum likelihood (ML) and time dependent (TD)) to estimate the reproduction numbers and observe the model fitness in the corresponding data set. Experimental results show that the reproduction numbers produced by these models are greater than 1.2 (approximately) indicates that COVID-19 is gradually spreading in the subcontinent.	Arxiv
167	Modeling time evolving COVID-19 uncertainties with density dependent   asymptomatic infections and social reinforcement. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges in modeling its complex epidemic transmissions, infection and contagion, which are very different from known epidemics. The challenges in quantifying COVID-19 complexities include effectively modeling its process and data uncertainties. The uncertainties are embedded in implicit and high-proportional undocumented infections, asymptomatic contagion, social reinforcement of infections, and various quality issues in the reported data. These uncertainties become even more apparent in the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the relevant knowledge, case reporting and testing were all limited. Here we introduce a novel hybrid approach Susceptible-Undocumented infected-Documented infected-Recovered (SUDR) model. First, SUDR (1) characterizes and distinguishes Undocumented (U) and Documented (D) infections commonly seen during COVID-19 incubation periods and asymptomatic infections. Second, SUDR characterizes the probabilistic density of infections by capturing exogenous processes. Lastly, SUDR approximates the density likelihood of COVID-19 prevalence over time by incorporating Bayesian inference into SUDR. Different from existing COVID-19 models, SUDR characterizes the undocumented infections during unknown transmission processes. To capture the uncertainties of temporal transmission and social reinforcement during COVID-19 contagion, the transmission rate is modeled by a time-varying density function of undocumented infectious cases. By sampling from the mean-field posterior distribution with reasonable priors, SUDR handles the randomness, noise and sparsity of COVID-19 observations widely seen in the public COVID-19 case data. The results demonstrate a deeper quantitative understanding of the above uncertainties, in comparison with classic SIR, time-dependent SIR, and probabilistic SIR models.	Arxiv
168	Federated Learning for COVID-19 Detection with Generative Adversarial   Networks in Edge Cloud Computing. COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe and become a deadly pandemic. Recently, many artificial intelligence-based approaches have been used for COVID-19 detection, but they often require public data sharing with cloud datacentres and thus remain privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new federated learning scheme, called FedGAN, to generate realistic COVID-19 images for facilitating privacy-enhanced COVID-19 detection with generative adversarial networks (GANs) in edge cloud computing. Particularly, we first propose a GAN where a discriminator and a generator based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at each edge-based medical institution alternatively are trained to mimic the real COVID-19 data distribution. Then, we propose a new federated learning solution which allows local GANs to collaborate and exchange learned parameters with a cloud server, aiming to enrich the global GAN model for generating realistic COVID-19 images without the need for sharing actual data. To enhance the privacy in federated COVID-19 data analytics, we integrate a differential privacy solution at each hospital institution. Moreover, we propose a new blockchain-based FedGAN framework for secure COVID-19 data analytics, by decentralizing the FL process with a new mining solution for low running latency. Simulations results demonstrate the superiority of our approach for COVID-19 detection over the state-of-the-art schemes.	Arxiv
169	"COVID-19 and Influenza Joint Forecasts Using Internet Search Information   in the United States. As COVID-19 pandemic progresses, severe flu seasons may happen alongside an increase in cases in cases and death of COVID-19, causing severe burdens on health care resources and public safety. A consequence of a twindemic may be a mixture of two different infections in the same person at the same time, ""flurona"". Admist the raising trend of ""flurona"", forecasting both influenza outbreaks and COVID-19 waves in a timely manner is more urgent than ever, as accurate joint real-time tracking of the twindemic aids health organizations and policymakers in adequate preparation and decision making. Under the current pandemic, state-of-art influenza and COVID-19 forecasting models carry valuable domain information but face shortcomings under current complex disease dynamics, such as similarities in symptoms and public healthcare seeking patterns of the two diseases. Inspired by the inner-connection between influenza and COVID-19 activities, we propose ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble which allows us to combine historical influenza and COVID-19 disease forecasting models to a new ensemble framework that handles scenarios where flu and COVID co-exist. Our framework is able to emphasize learning from COVID-related or influenza signals, through a winner-takes-all ensemble fashion. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that our approach is successful in adapting past influenza forecasting models to the current pandemic, while improving upon previous COVID-19 forecasting models, by steadily outperforming alternative benchmark methods, and remaining competitive with publicly available models."

170	HRCTCov19 -- A High-Resolution Chest CT Scan Image Dataset for COVID-19   Diagnosis and Differentiation. Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, computed tomography (CT) was a popular method for diagnosing COVID-19 patients. HRCT (High-Resolution Computed Tomography) is a form of computed tomography that uses advanced methods to improve image resolution. Publicly accessible COVID-19 CT image datasets are very difficult to come by due to privacy concerns, which impedes the study and development of AI-powered COVID-19 diagnostic algorithms based on CT images. Data description: To address this problem, we have introduced HRCTCov19, a new COVID-19 high-resolution chest CT scan image dataset that includes not only COVID-19 cases of Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), Crazy Paving, and Air Space Consolidation but also CT images of cases with negative COVID-19. The HRCTCov19 dataset, which includes slice-level, and patient-level labels, has the potential to aid COVID-19 research, especially for diagnosis and differentiation using artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning methods. This dataset is accessible through the web at: http://databiox.com and includes 181,106 chest HRCT images from 395 patients with four labels: GGO, Crazy Paving, Air Space Consolidation, and Negative.

171	Dynamics of COVID-19 models with asymptomatic infections and quarantine   measures. Considering the propagation characteristics of COVID-19 in different regions, the dynamics analysis and numerical demonstration of long-term and short-term models of COVID-19 are carried out, respectively. The long-term model is devoted to investigate the global stability of COVID-19 model with asymptomatic infections and quarantine measures. By using the limit system of the model and Lyapunov function method, it is shown that the COVID-19-free equilibrium $V^0$ is globally asymptotically stable if the control reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_{c}<1$ and globally attractive if $\mathcal{R}_{c}=1$, which means that COVID-19 will die out; the COVID-19 equilibrium $V^{\ast}$ is globally asymptotically stable if $\mathcal{R}_{c}>1$, which means that COVID-19 will be persistent. In particular, to obtain the local stability of $V^{\ast}$, we use proof by contradiction and the properties of complex modulus with some novel details, and we prove the weak persistence of the system to obtain the global attractivity of $V^{\ast}$. Moreover, the final size of the corresponding short-term model is calculated and the stability of its multiple equilibria is analyzed. Numerical simulations of COVID-19 cases show that quarantine measures and asymptomatic infections have a non-negligible impact on the transmission of COVID-19.	Arxiv
172	"Unraveling Post-COVID-19 Immune Dysregulation Using Machine   Learning-based Immunophenotyping. The COVID-19 pandemic has left a significant mark on global healthcare, with many individuals experiencing lingering symptoms long after recovering from the acute phase of the disease, a condition often referred to as ""long COVID."" This study delves into the intricate realm of immune dysregulation that ensues in 509 post-COVID-19 patients across multiple Iraqi regions during the years 2022 and 2023. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques for immunophenotyping, this research aims to shed light on the diverse immune dysregulation patterns present in long COVID patients. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset encompassing clinical, immunological, and demographic information, the study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of immune responses following COVID-19 infection. The findings reveal that long COVID is associated with a spectrum of immune dysregulation phenomena, including persistent inflammation, altered cytokine profiles, and abnormal immune cell subsets. These insights highlight the need for personalized interventions and tailored treatment strategies for individuals suffering from long COVID-19. This research represents a significant step forward in our understanding of the post-COVID-19 immune landscape and opens new avenues for targeted therapies and clinical management of long COVID patients. As the world grapples with the long-term implications of the pandemic, these findings offer hope for improving the quality of life for those affected by this enigmatic condition."	Arxiv

The research titled ""Early Detection of Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome using Deep Learning Models"" addresses a pressing concern arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome (PCFS) has become a significant health issue affecting individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection. This study harnesses a robust dataset comprising 940 patients from diverse age groups, whose medical records were collected from various hospitals in Iraq over the years 2022, 2022, and 2023. The primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate deep learning models for the early detection of PCFS. Leveraging the power of deep learning, these models are trained on a comprehensive set of clinical and demographic features extracted from the dataset. The goal is to enable timely identification of PCFS symptoms in post-COVID-19 patients, which can lead to more effective interventions and improved patient outcomes. The study's findings underscore the potential of deep learning in healthcare, particularly in the context of COVID-19 recovery. Early detection of PCFS can aid healthcare professionals in providing timely care and support to affected individuals, potentially reducing the long-term impact of this syndrome on their quality of life. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge surrounding COVID-19-related health complications and highlights the importance of leveraging advanced machine learning techniques for early diagnosis and intervention.

174	Developing a Multi-variate Prediction Model For COVID-19 From   Crowd-sourced Respiratory Voice Data. COVID-19 has affected more than 223 countries worldwide and in the Post-COVID Era, there is a pressing need for non-invasive, low-cost, and highly scalable solutions to detect COVID-19. We develop a deep learning model to identify COVID-19 from voice recording data. The novelty of this work is in the development of deep learning models for COVID-19 identification from only voice recordings. We use the Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database which contains 893 speech samples, crowd-sourced from 4352 participants via a COVID-19 Sounds app. Voice features including Mel-spectrograms and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and CNN Encoder features are extracted. Based on the voice data, we develop deep learning classification models to detect COVID-19 cases. These models include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Hidden-Unit BERT (HuBERT). We compare their predictive power to baseline machine learning models. HuBERT achieves the highest accuracy of 86\% and the highest AUC of 0.93. The results achieved with the proposed models suggest promising results in COVID-19 diagnosis from voice recordings when compared to the results obtained from the state-of-the-art.	Arxiv
175	COVID-Net: A Tailored Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design for   Detection of COVID-19 Cases from Chest X-Ray Images. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health and well-being of the global population. A critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography. Motivated by this and inspired by the open source efforts of the research community, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. To the best of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases, with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the best of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who need it the most.

176	COVID-DA: Deep Domain Adaptation from Typical Pneumonia to COVID-19. The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already infected millions of people and is still rapidly spreading all over the globe. Most COVID-19 patients suffer from lung infection, so one important diagnostic method is to screen chest radiography images, e.g., X-Ray or CT images. However, such examinations are time-consuming and labor-intensive, leading to limited diagnostic efficiency. To solve this issue, AI-based technologies, such as deep learning, have been used recently as effective computer-aided means to improve diagnostic efficiency. However, one practical and critical difficulty is the limited availability of annotated COVID-19 data, due to the prohibitive annotation costs and urgent work of doctors to fight against the pandemic. This makes the learning of deep diagnosis models very challenging. To address this, motivated by that typical pneumonia has similar characteristics with COVID-19 and many pneumonia datasets are publicly available, we propose to conduct domain knowledge adaptation from typical pneumonia to COVID-19. There are two main challenges: 1) the discrepancy of data distributions between domains; 2) the task difference between the diagnosis of typical pneumonia and COVID-19. To address them, we propose a new deep domain adaptation method for COVID-19 diagnosis, namely COVID-DA. Specifically, we alleviate the domain discrepancy via feature adversarial adaptation and handle the task difference issue via a novel classifier separation scheme. In this way, COVID-DA is able to diagnose COVID-19 effectively with only a small number of COVID-19 annotations. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of COVID-DA and its great potential for real-world applications.	Arxiv
177	"COVID-FACT: A Fully-Automated Capsule Network-based Framework for   Identification of COVID-19 Cases from Chest CT scans. The newly discovered Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been globally spreading and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world as of its first emergence in late 2019. Computed tomography (CT) scans have shown distinctive features and higher sensitivity compared to other diagnostic tests, in particular the current gold standard, i.e., the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Current deep learning-based algorithms are mainly developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify COVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however, require extensive data augmentation and large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations between image instances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend slice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding mechanism or rely on a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the disease. In this paper, we propose a two-stage fully-automated CT-based framework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases referred to as the ""COVID-FACT"". COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks and is, therefore, capable of capturing spatial information. In particular, to make the proposed COVID-FACT independent from sophisticated segmentation of the area of infection, slices demonstrating infection are detected at the first stage and the second stage is responsible for classifying patients into COVID and non-COVID cases. COVID-FACT detects slices with infection, and identifies positive COVID-19 cases using an in-house CT scan dataset, containing COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia, and normal cases. Based on our experiments, COVID-FACT achieves an accuracy of 90.82%, a sensitivity of 94.55%, a specificity of 86.04%, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, while depending on far less supervision and annotation, in comparison to its counterparts."

178	COVID-MTL: Multitask Learning with Shift3D and Random-weighted Loss for   Automated Diagnosis and Severity Assessment of COVID-19. There is an urgent need for automated methods to assist accurate and effective assessment of COVID-19. Radiology and nucleic acid test (NAT) are complementary COVID-19 diagnosis methods. In this paper, we present an end-to-end multitask learning (MTL) framework (COVID-MTL) that is capable of automated and simultaneous detection (against both radiology and NAT) and severity assessment of COVID-19. COVID-MTL learns different COVID-19 tasks in parallel through our novel random-weighted loss function, which assigns learning weights under Dirichlet distribution to prevent task dominance; our new 3D real-time augmentation algorithm (Shift3D) introduces space variances for 3D CNN components by shifting low-level feature representations of volumetric inputs in three dimensions; thereby, the MTL framework is able to accelerate convergence and improve joint learning performance compared to single-task models. By only using chest CT scans, COVID-MTL was trained on 930 CT scans and tested on separate 399 cases. COVID-MTL achieved AUCs of 0.939 and 0.846, and accuracies of 90.23% and 79.20% for detection of COVID-19 against radiology and NAT, respectively, which outperformed the state-of-the-art models. Meanwhile, COVID-MTL yielded AUC of 0.800 $\pm$ 0.020 and 0.813 $\pm$ 0.021 (with transfer learning) for classifying control/suspected, mild/regular, and severe/critically-ill cases. To decipher the recognition mechanism, we also identified high-throughput lung features that were significantly related (P < 0.001) to the positivity and severity of COVID-19.	Arxiv
179	QUCoughScope: An Artificially Intelligent Mobile Application to Detect   Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patients using Cough and Breathing Sounds. In the break of COVID-19 pandemic, mass testing has become essential to reduce the spread of the virus. Several recent studies suggest that a significant number of COVID-19 patients display no physical symptoms whatsoever. Therefore, it is unlikely that these patients will undergo COVID-19 test, which increases their chances of unintentionally spreading the virus. Currently, the primary diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 is RT-PCR test on collected respiratory specimens from the suspected case. This requires patients to travel to a laboratory facility to be tested, thereby potentially infecting others along the way.It is evident from recent researches that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients cough and breath in a different way than the healthy people. Several research groups have created mobile and web-platform for crowdsourcing the symptoms, cough and breathing sounds from healthy, COVID-19 and Non-COVID patients. Some of these data repositories were made public. We have received such a repository from Cambridge University team under data-sharing agreement, where we have cough and breathing sound samples for 582 and 141 healthy and COVID-19 patients, respectively. 87 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, while rest of them have cough. We have developed an Android application to automatically screen COVID-19 from the comfort of people homes. Test subjects can simply download a mobile application, enter their symptoms, record an audio clip of their cough and breath, and upload the data anonymously to our servers. Our backend server converts the audio clip to spectrogram and then apply our state-of-the-art machine learning model to classify between cough sounds produced by COVID-19 patients, as opposed to healthy subjects or those with other respiratory conditions. The system can detect asymptomatic COVID-19 patients with a sensitivity more than 91%.	Arxiv
180	COVID-19 Detection and Analysis From Lung CT Images using Novel Channel   Boosted CNNs. In December 2019, the global pandemic COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, affected human life and the worldwide economy. Therefore, an efficient diagnostic system is required to control its spread. However, the automatic diagnostic system poses challenges with a limited amount of labeled data, minor contrast variation, and high structural similarity between infection and background. In this regard, a new two-phase deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based diagnostic system is proposed to detect minute irregularities and analyze COVID-19 infection. In the first phase, a novel SB-STM-BRNet CNN is developed, incorporating a new channel Squeezed and Boosted (SB) and dilated convolutional-based Split-Transform-Merge (STM) block to detect COVID-19 infected lung CT images. The new STM blocks performed multi-path region-smoothing and boundary operations, which helped to learn minor contrast variation and global COVID-19 specific patterns. Furthermore, the diverse boosted channels are achieved using the SB and Transfer Learning concepts in STM blocks to learn texture variation between COVID-19-specific and healthy images. In the second phase, COVID-19 infected images are provided to the novel COVID-CB-RESeg segmentation CNN to identify and analyze COVID-19 infectious regions. The proposed COVID-CB-RESeg methodically employed region-homogeneity and heterogeneity operations in each encoder-decoder block and boosted-decoder using auxiliary channels to simultaneously learn the low illumination and boundaries of the COVID-19 infected region. The proposed diagnostic system yields good performance in terms of accuracy: 98.21 %, F-score: 98.24%, Dice Similarity: 96.40 %, and IOU: 98.85 % for the COVID-19 infected region. The proposed diagnostic system would reduce the burden and strengthen the radiologist's decision for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.	Arxiv
181	Identifying Radiological Findings Related to COVID-19 from Medical   Literature. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than one million individuals all over the world and caused more than 55,000 deaths, as of April 3 in 2020. Radiological findings are important sources of information in guiding the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. However, the existing studies on how radiological findings are correlated with COVID-19 are conducted separately by different hospitals, which may be inconsistent or even conflicting due to population bias. To address this problem, we develop natural language processing methods to analyze a large collection of COVID-19 literature containing study reports from hospitals all over the world, reconcile these results, and draw unbiased and universally-sensible conclusions about the correlation between radiological findings and COVID-19. We apply our method to the CORD-19 dataset and successfully extract a set of radiological findings that are closely tied to COVID-19.	Arxiv
182	Deep Learning COVID-19 Features on CXR using Limited Training Data Sets. Under the global pandemic of COVID-19, the use of artificial intelligence to analyze chest X-ray (CXR) image for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage is becoming important. Unfortunately, due to the emergent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, a systematic collection of the CXR data set for deep neural network training is difficult. To address this problem, here we propose a patch-based convolutional neural network approach with a relatively small number of trainable parameters for COVID-19 diagnosis. The proposed method is inspired by our statistical analysis of the potential imaging biomarkers of the CXR radiographs. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and provides clinically interpretable saliency maps, which are useful for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage.	Arxiv

Given that social media can bring us valuable information about COVID-19 at a global scale, it is important to share the data and encourage social media studies against COVID-19 or other infectious diseases. Therefore, we have released a multilingual dataset of social media posts related to COVID-19, consisting of microblogs in English and Japanese from Twitter and those in Chinese from Weibo. The data cover microblogs from January 20, 2020, to March 24, 2020.

184	Evaluating Policies Early in a Pandemic: Bounding Policy Effects with   Nonrandomly Missing Data. During the early part of the Covid-19 pandemic, national and local governments introduced a number of policies to combat the spread of Covid-19. In this paper, we propose a new approach to bound the effects of such early-pandemic policies on Covid-19 cases and other outcomes while dealing with complications arising from (i) limited availability of Covid-19 tests, (ii) differential availability of Covid-19 tests across locations, and (iii) eligibility requirements for individuals to be tested. We use our approach study the effects of Tennessee's expansion of Covid-19 testing early in the pandemic and find that the policy decreased Covid-19 cases.	Arxiv
185	Experiments of Federated Learning for COVID-19 Chest X-ray Images. AI plays an important role in COVID-19 identification. Computer vision and deep learning techniques can assist in determining COVID-19 infection with Chest X-ray Images. However, for the protection and respect of the privacy of patients, the hospital's specific medical-related data did not allow leakage and sharing without permission. Collecting such training data was a major challenge. To a certain extent, this has caused a lack of sufficient data samples when performing deep learning approaches to detect COVID-19. Federated Learning is an available way to address this issue. It can effectively address the issue of data silos and get a shared model without obtaining local data. In the work, we propose the use of federated learning for COVID-19 data training and deploy experiments to verify the effectiveness. And we also compare performances of four popular models (MobileNet, ResNet18, MoblieNet, and COVID-Net) with the federated learning framework and without the framework. This work aims to inspire more researches on federated learning about COVID-19.	Arxiv
186	COVID-19 Induced Economic Uncertainty: A Comparison between the United   Kingdom and the United States. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic policy uncertainty in the US and the UK. The impact of the increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country, and the increase in the number of cases and deaths outside the country may vary. To examine this, the study employs bootstrap ARDL cointegration approach from March 8, 2020 to May 24, 2020. According to the bootstrap ARDL results, a long-run equilibrium relationship is confirmed for five out of the 10 models. The long-term coefficients obtained from the ARDL models suggest that an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths outside of the UK and the US has a significant effect on economic policy uncertainty. The US is more affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The UK, on the other hand, is more negatively affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 deaths outside the country than the increase in the number of cases. Moreover, another important finding from the study demonstrates that COVID-19 is a factor of great uncertainty for both countries in the short-term.	Arxiv

188	Quantifying the impact of COVID-19 on the US stock market: An analysis   from multi-source information. We develop a novel temporal complex network approach to quantify the US county level spread dynamics of COVID-19. The objective is to study the effects of the local spread dynamics, COVID-19 cases and death, and Google search activities on the US stock market. We use both conventional econometric and Machine Learning (ML) models. The results suggest that COVID-19 cases and deaths, its local spread, and Google searches have impacts on abnormal stock prices between January 2020 to May 2020. In addition, incorporating information about local spread significantly improves the performance of forecasting models of the abnormal stock prices at longer forecasting horizons. On the other hand, although a few COVID-19 related variables, e.g., US total deaths and US new cases exhibit causal relationships on price volatility, COVID-19 cases and deaths, local spread of COVID-19, and Google search activities do not have impacts on price volatility.

189	Assess the impacts of human mobility change on COVID-19 dynamics in   Arizona, U.S.: a modeling study incorporating Google Community Mobility   Reports. In June 2020, Arizona, U.S., emerged as one of the world's worst coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) spots after the stay-at-home order was lifted in the middle of May. However, with the decisions to reimpose restrictions, the number of COVID-19 cases has been declining, and Arizona is considered to be a good model in slowing the epidemic. In this paper, we aimed to examine the COVID-19 situation in Arizona and assess the impact of human mobility change. We constructed the mobility integrated metapopulation susceptible-infectious-removed model and fitted to publicly available datasets on COVID-19 cases and mobility changes in Arizona. Our simulations showed that by reducing human mobility, the peak time was delayed, and the final size of the epidemic was decreased in all three regions. Our analysis suggests that rapid and effective decision making is crucial to control human mobility and, therefore, COVID-19 epidemics. Until a vaccine is available, reimplementations of mobility restrictions in response to the increase of new COVID-19 cases might need to be considered in Arizona and beyond.	Arxiv
190	Clustering COVID-19 Lung Scans. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the characteristics of the virus has become an important and challenging task in the scientific community. While tests do exist for COVID-19, the goal of our research is to explore other methods of identifying infected individuals. Our group applied unsupervised clustering techniques to explore a dataset of lungscans of COVID-19 infected, Viral Pneumonia infected, and healthy individuals. This is an important area to explore as COVID-19 is a novel disease that is currently being studied in detail. Our methodology explores the potential that unsupervised clustering algorithms have to reveal important hidden differences between COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses. Our experiments use: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means++ (KM++) and the recently developed Robust Continuous Clustering algorithm (RCC). We evaluate the performance of KM++ and RCC in clustering COVID-19 lung scans using the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) score.	Arxiv
191	Pay Attention to the cough: Early Diagnosis of COVID-19 using   Interpretable Symptoms Embeddings with Cough Sound Signal Processing. COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to a treacherous and devastating catastrophe for humanity. At the time of writing, no specific antivirus drugs or vaccines are recommended to control infection transmission and spread. The current diagnosis of COVID-19 is done by Reverse-Transcription Polymer Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing. However, this method is expensive, time-consuming, and not easily available in straitened regions. An interpretable and COVID-19 diagnosis AI framework is devised and developed based on the cough sounds features and symptoms metadata to overcome these limitations. The proposed framework's performance was evaluated using a medical dataset containing Symptoms and Demographic data of 30000 audio segments, 328 cough sounds from 150 patients with four cough classes ( COVID-19, Asthma, Bronchitis, and Healthy). Experiments' results show that the model captures the better and robust feature embedding to distinguish between COVID-19 patient coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs with higher specificity and accuracy of 95.04 $\pm$ 0.18% and 96.83$\pm$ 0.18% respectively, all the while maintaining interpretability.

192	Synthesis of COVID-19 Chest X-rays using Unpaired Image-to-Image   Translation. Motivated by the lack of publicly available datasets of chest radiographs of positive patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we build the first-of-its-kind open dataset of synthetic COVID-19 chest X-ray images of high fidelity using an unsupervised domain adaptation approach by leveraging class conditioning and adversarial training. Our contributions are twofold. First, we show considerable performance improvements on COVID-19 detection using various deep learning architectures when employing synthetic images as additional training set. Second, we show how our image synthesis method can serve as a data anonymization tool by achieving comparable detection performance when trained only on synthetic data. In addition, the proposed data generation framework offers a viable solution to the COVID-19 detection in particular, and to medical image classification tasks in general. Our publicly available benchmark dataset consists of 21,295 synthetic COVID-19 chest X-ray images. The insights gleaned from this dataset can be used for preventive actions in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.	Arxiv
193	When the Open Source Community Meets COVID-19: Characterizing COVID-19   themed GitHub Repositories. Ever since the beginning of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers from interdisciplinary domains have worked together to fight against the crisis. The open source community, plays a vital role in coping with the pandemic which is inherently a collaborative process. Plenty of COVID-19 related datasets, tools, software, deep learning models, are created and shared in research communities with great efforts. However, COVID-19 themed open source projects have not been systematically studied, and we are still unaware how the open source community helps combat COVID-19 in practice. To fill this void, in this paper, we take the first step to study COVID-19 themed repositories in GitHub, one of the most popular collaborative platforms. We have collected over 67K COVID-19 themed GitHub repositories till July 2020. We then characterize them from a number of aspects and classify them into six categories. We further investigate the contribution patterns of the contributors, and development and maintenance patterns of the repositories. This study sheds light on the promising direction of adopting open source technologies and resources to rapidly tackle the worldwide public health emergency in practice, and reveals existing challenges for improvement.

194	Impact of COVID-19 on Mobility and Electric Vehicle Charging Load. The COVID-19 pandemic has depressed overall mobility across the country. The changes seen reflect responses to new COVID-19 cases, local health guidelines, and seasonality, making the relationship between mobility and COVID-19 unique from region to region. This paper presents a data-driven case study of electric vehicle (EV) charging and mobility in the wake of COVID-19. The study shows that the number of EV charging sessions and total energy consumed per day dropped by 40% immediately after the arrival of the first COVID-19 case in Utah. By contrast, the energy consumed per charging session fell by just 8% over the same periods and the distribution of session start and end times remained consistent throughout the year. While EV mobility dropped more dramatically than total vehicle mobility during the first wave of COVID-19 cases, and returned more slowly, both returned to stable levels near their mean values by September 2020, despite a dramatic third wave in new infections.

195	Covid-19 diagnosis from x-ray using neural networks. Corona virus or COVID-19 is a pandemic illness, which has influenced more than million of causalities worldwide and infected a few large number of individuals .Innovative instrument empowering quick screening of the COVID-19 contamination with high precision can be critically useful to the medical care experts. The primary clinical device presently being used for the analysis of COVID-19 is the Reverse record polymerase chain response as known as RT-PCR, which is costly, less-delicate and requires specific clinical work force. X-Ray imaging is an effectively available apparatus that can be a great option in the COVID-19 conclusion. This exploration was taken to examine the utility of computerized reasoning in the quick and exact recognition of COVID-19 from chest X-Ray pictures. The point of this paper is to propose a procedure for programmed recognition of COVID-19 from advanced chest X-Ray images applying pre-prepared profound learning calculations while boosting the discovery exactness. The point is to give over-focused on clinical experts a second pair of eyes through a learning picture characterization models. We distinguish an appropriate Convolutional Neural Network-CNN model through beginning similar investigation of a few mainstream CNN models.	Arxiv
196	Meta-research on COVID-19: An overview of the early trends. COVID-19 is having a dramatic impact on research and researchers. The pandemic has underlined the severity of known challenges in research and surfaced new ones, but also accelerated the adoption of innovations and manifested new opportunities. This review considers early trends emerging from meta-research on COVID-19. In particular, it focuses on the following topics: i) mapping COVID-19 research; ii) data and machine learning; iii) research practices including open access and open data, reviewing, publishing and funding; iv) communicating research to the public; v) the impact of COVID-19 on researchers, in particular with respect to gender and career trajectories. This overview finds that most early meta-research on COVID-19 has been reactive and focused on short-term questions, while more recently a shift to consider the long-term consequences of COVID-19 is taking place. Based on these findings, the author speculates that some aspects of doing research during COVID-19 are more likely to persist than others. These include: the shift to virtual for academic events such as conferences; the use of openly accessible pre-prints; the `datafication' of scholarly literature and consequent broader adoption of machine learning in science communication; the public visibility of research and researchers on social and online media.

197	Heterogeneous network-based drug repurposing for COVID-19. The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) belongs to human coronaviruses (HCoVs), which spreads rapidly around the world. Compared with new drug development, drug repurposing may be the best shortcut for treating COVID-19. Therefore, we constructed a comprehensive heterogeneous network based on the HCoVs-related target proteins and use the previously proposed deepDTnet, to discover potential drug candidates for COVID-19. We obtain high performance in predicting the possible drugs effective for COVID-19 related proteins. In summary, this work utilizes a powerful heterogeneous network-based deep learning method, which may be beneficial to quickly identify candidate repurposable drugs toward future clinical trials for COVID-19. The code and data are available at https://github.com/stjin-XMU/HnDR-COVID.	Arxiv
198	Smoking prevalence in Covid-19 patients. We investigate the prevalence rate of smoking in Covid-19 patients and examine whether there is a difference in the distribution of smokers between the two statistical populations of critically ill patients with Covid-19 and the entire Iranian population or not. To do this, we first prepared a sample of 1040 Covid-19 patients admitted to hospitals in Tehran, Rasht, and Bojnord. Then, through the non-parametric statistical runs test, we show that the sample was randomly selected, and it is possible to generalize the result of tests on the sample to the community of hospitalized Covid-19 patients. In continuation, we examined the hypothesis that the smoking prevalence among Covid-19 patients admitted to hospitals is equal to the prevalence rate of smoking in Iranian society. For this purpose, we used the non-parametric chi-square test, and it was observed that this hypothesis is rejected. The data show a significant difference in the prevalence of smoking between critically ill Covid-19 patients and the whole of Iranian society. Additionally, we examined this hypothesis in some subpopulations, and the results were the same.	Arxiv
199	Towards a GDPR-Compliant Blockchain-Based COVID Vaccination Passport. The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world and limited work/personal life activities. Besides the loss of human lives and agony faced by humankind, the pandemic has badly hit different sectors economically, including the travel industry. Special arrangements, including COVID test before departure and on arrival, and voluntary quarantine, were enforced to limit the risk of transmission. However, the hope for returning to a normal (pre-COVID) routine relies on the success of the current COVID vaccination drives administered by different countries. To open for tourism and other necessary travel, a need is realized for a universally accessible proof of COVID vaccination, allowing travelers to cross the borders without any hindrance. This paper presents an architectural framework for a GDPR-compliant blockchain-based COVID vaccination passport (VacciFi), whilst considering the relevant developments, especially in the European Union region.
